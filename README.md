- **[2025-03-09]** AIBrix v0.2.1 is released. DeepSeek-R1 full weights deployment is supported and gateway stability has been improved! Check [Blog Post](https://aibrix.github.io/posts/2025-03-10-deepseek-r1/) for more details.
- **[2025-02-19]** AIBrix v0.2.0 is released. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/vllm-project/aibrix/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for more details.

## Key Features

The initial release includes the following key features:

- **High-Density LoRA Management**: Streamlined support for lightweight, low-rank adaptations of models.
- **LLM Gateway and Routing**: Efficiently manage and direct traffic across multiple models and replicas.
- **LLM App-Tailored Autoscaler**: Dynamically scale inference resources based on real-time demand.
- **Unified AI Runtime**: A versatile sidecar enabling metric standardization, model downloading, and management.
- **Distributed Inference**: Scalable architecture to handle large workloads across multiple nodes.
- **Distributed KV Cache**: Enables high-capacity, cross-engine KV reuse.
- **Cost-efficient Heterogeneous Serving**: Enables mixed GPU inference to reduce costs with SLO guarantees.
- **GPU Hardware Failure Detection**: Proactive detection of GPU hardware issues.

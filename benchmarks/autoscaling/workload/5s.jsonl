The Hero\u2019s Journey is a structure that has been followed by some of the greatest stories ever told and ever lived.\n\nThe version of this journey described throughout the document is tailored for Kadence and is meant to serve as a reference point and a workspace for ideas, planning, and the execution of specialized tactics in order to continuously develop and progress the story which underlies the public representation of the ideas covered in this document.\n\nThe Journey, its associated ambitions, milestones, challenges, and gimmicks are experimental in nature, and thus are used to further our own research into the business of artist development, and quite possible leaving our mark on the World.\n\n## \\*\\*What is within this document?\\*\\*\n\nThis document contains a whole lot of useful information about characters, possible pathways of progression, theoretical understandings from The Hero\u2019s Journey, and much more. Overall, this document is a collection of all types of information that is relevant to the project undertakings described above.\n\n## \\*\\*How should this document be used?\\*\\*\n\nThis document should be seen strictly as an experimental guideline line used to plan and execute experimental content and plot lines with the intent of learning from experiment results and making changes to procedures in the future where necessary. With regards to content, the content database provided in this document will be used to visualize the potential timeline of events that will transpire once the official process has gone underway (ie. when the first piece of planned content is released to the public and the timeline must be adhered to.)\n\nIn addition to the content calendar, the document will be the gathering place for information deemed useful during the planning and execution process of projects such as the Docu-Series. This information serves to fuel the end-user content that is scheduled and created. By using the Hero\u2019s Journey as a guideline, maximum impact can be gradually attained via meticulous planning and execution of ordered story elements once it is distilled into its relevant parts here inside this document.\n\n## \\*\\*What is The Story\\*\\*\n\nThe Story is a character arch guideline for the Docu-series that is derived from the content of this page. It occurs over a discrete time period, subtly growing in both complexity and depth. The point of using a story is simple, it allows us as the creators of content to understand what type of activities, emotions, themes, places, people, and other story elements to include in order to progress the story, in film format, from a clear beginning to a decisive end without relying on specific events or in real life occurrences that might be outside of our control. By determining the characters in the story, as well as their personalities, aspirations, fears, hopes, and desires, we will be able to translate the implied reality of those characters into practical actions and plot points that can be made in the real world to add a touch of fantasy-like takeaways to the project.\n\nBy taking the time to understand both the created characters and their real life counterparts, we ensure maximum compatibility with your (you reading this document) own personal journey, as well as the journey of the characters within the story. This allows us to create a seamless and coherent narrative that will captivate and engage our audience, while also providing a meaningful and impactful experience for everyone involved.\n\nIn order to fully realize the potential of this project and to bring [The Story] to life, it is important to have a clear understanding of the key elements of The Hero\u2019s Journey, as well as an understanding of the specific goals and objectives of the project. With this information in hand, we can begin to craft a unique and compelling story that will capture the hearts and minds of our audience.\n\n### The Journey Ahead\n\nAs we embark on this journey, it is important to remember that this is an experiment and that the path ahead may be uncertain. However, by using The Hero\u2019s Journey as our guide, we can be sure to make the most of every opportunity that comes our way. With careful planning and execution, we can turn this project into something truly special and leave a lasting impact on the world.\n\"\n\n What is the next portion I should write?"}]}

They can adjust the inputs to see how different scenarios might impact crop growth and yield. This can help farmers make informed decisions about planting and crop management practices, ultimately leading to higher yields and profitability."}]}
{"timestamp": 26, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 547, "Output Length": 29, "prompt": "1. Does the RESTRICT Act violate the First Amendment right to free speech?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act focuses on national security risks and user privacy concerns related to certain transactions and holdings involving information and communication technology products or services. It does not directly address freedom of speech. However, critics may argue that the Act's potential to restrict access to certain platforms, like TikTok, could infringe on the First Amendment right to free speech. While the Act itself does not ban individual use of these platforms, it could still limit access to them and therefore have an impact on free speech. Ultimately, it will be up to the courts to determine if any specific actions taken under the Act violate the First Amendment.\n\n1. Is the RESTRICT Act too broad in its scope?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act gives the Secretary of Commerce broad authority to review and potentially restrict certain transactions and holdings involving information and communication technology products or services. Some may argue that this authority is too broad and could potentially be abused or used to unfairly target certain entities or individuals. However, supporters of the Act argue that this broad authority is necessary to effectively address national security risks and user privacy concerns related to foreign-owned platforms and products.\n\n1. Could the RESTRICT Act negatively impact international relations?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act may have an impact on international relations, particularly with countries whose companies and platforms may be subject to review under the Act. Critics may argue that the Act could be seen as overly aggressive and could potentially strain relationships with foreign governments. However, supporters of the Act may argue that it is necessary to protect national security and that the potential impact on international relations is outweighed by the benefits of increased security.\n\n1. Could the RESTRICT Act be used to unfairly target certain countries or companies?\n\nCritics of the RESTRICT Act may argue that it could be used to unfairly target certain countries or companies, particularly those that are seen as political or economic rivals to the United States. However, supporters of the Act may argue that the focus is on national security and user privacy concerns, rather than political or economic motivations. Ultimately, it will be up to the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that any actions taken under the Act are based on legitimate concerns related to national security and user privacy.\n\n1. How will the RESTRICT Act impact the global tech industry?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act could potentially have a significant impact on the global tech industry, particularly if it leads to increased restrictions on foreign-owned platforms and products. This could lead to increased competition among domestic companies, as well as increased pressure on foreign companies to conform to US regulations. However, it could also lead to decreased innovation and collaboration among global tech companies, as they may become more hesitant to work with each other due to potential national security risks."}]}

Introduction\nIn England's countryside, there lived a young lass,\nWhose parents had passed, leaving her alone in a vast,\nEstate owned by her uncle, a man so austere,\nWho had no time for her, nor care to appear.\n\nMary was her name, and she felt quite alone,\nNo friends to play with, no one to call her own,\nBut one day while exploring, she found a surprise,\nA secret garden, hidden away from prying eyes.\n\n1. Discovery of the Garden\nThe garden was locked up, with a rusted old key,\nBut Mary was curious, she wanted to see,\nWhat was inside that garden, what lay beyond,\nSo she searched high and low, till she found the bond.\n\nAs she walked through the garden, she felt a strange thrill,\nSeeing flowers and trees that had been silent and still,\nFor years they had slept, but now they awoke,\nAnd Mary felt a stirring, a strange, joyous poke.\n\n1. Friendship with Dickon\nSoon, Mary met a boy, a farmer's son,\nHis name was Dickon, he was full of fun,\nHe showed her the ways of the garden, and how,\nTo plant, water, and care for each flower and bough.\n\nTogether they worked, till the garden was bright,\nWith colors so vivid, a truly wonderful sight,\nMary had found a friend, one that was true,\nSomeone who helped her, when she was feeling blue.\n\n1. The Transformation of the Garden\nOver time, the garden transformed, bloomed, and grew,\nMary and Dickon had done it, they knew what to do,\nThe garden was alive, with sounds and scents so rare,\nA place that was magical, beyond compare.\n\nThe garden became a symbol, of hope and of love,\nFor those who were hurting, who felt lost, who needed a shove,\nIt reminded them that with effort and care,\nThey too could grow something, that was lovely and fair.\n\n1. Conclusion\nMary had found something, beyond wealth or fame,\nA garden that grew, a friendship that came,\nFrom working together, and never giving up,\nEven when things seemed hard, like an empty cup.\n\nThe garden taught her, the value of life,\nAnd how even in sorrow, there's a chance to thrive,\nMary's journey was a lesson, for young and old,\nAbout the power of friendship, and the beauty that's told.\n\nMoral of the Story:\nThrough Mary's journey, we learn that friendship is key,\nTo growth, transformation, and living life fully,\nWith hard work and perseverance, anything's possible,\nA secret garden of love and hope, that's truly remarkable."}]}

After the subprocess completes, the response data is read from a file that the Python script writes to, and the file is deleted.

We use the `data` event of the first response to detect the end of the `<head>` section, then split the chunk into two parts: the `<head>` section and the rest of the HTML. We enqueue the `<head>` section and start streaming the rest of the HTML from the second response. We use a boolean variable `headDone` to keep track of whether we have already processed the `<head>` section.

{"timestamp": 491, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 649, "Output Length": 29, "prompt": "The Helpmates venture pitch seeks to capitalize on a rapidly aging population and their growing need for assistance services. The pitch identifies a favorable societal and regulatory context, which is crucial for any new venture to succeed (Gartner, 1988). Moreover, the pitch highlights a clear market and customer needs, providing a compelling value proposition that resonates with potential customers (Kuratko et al., 2015). However, the pitch also presents some weaknesses that must be addressed to enhance its potential for success.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the pitch is its alignment with the demographic shift in the population, which creates a favorable window of opportunity for the venture (Eisenman, 2013). By leveraging this trend, the founders can position Helpmates as a valuable service that addresses the unmet needs of an aging population. The pitch also demonstrates a strong understanding of the target market, which is crucial for identifying and addressing customer needs effectively (Zhao & Seibert, 2006). This understanding is reflected in the pitch's articulation of a clear value proposition that appeals to customers who are willing to pay for the services offered.\n\nDespite these strengths, the pitch falls short in several areas. First, the competitive dynamics of the industry are not adequately addressed, raising concerns about the venture's ability to differentiate itself from established players (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). To mitigate this weakness, the founders should conduct a thorough competitive analysis, identifying potential threats and opportunities, and develop strategies to differentiate their offering (Markman & Baron, 2003).\n\nSecond, the financial strength of the opportunity remains unclear due to a lack of detailed information on revenue projections, cost structures, and funding plans (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Providing a comprehensive financial plan can help the founders make informed decisions about the venture's growth and development, and it can also instill confidence in potential investors. Further, a robust financial plan demonstrates the founders' understanding of the economic aspects of their venture, which is vital for its success (Garvin & Levesque, 2006).\n\nThird, the pitch's implementation plan appears overly optimistic, with limited attention paid to potential challenges and risks. The founders should develop a more detailed and realistic implementation plan that incorporates strategies for managing risks and overcoming the liabilities of newness and size (Moroz & Hindle, 2012). This plan should be grounded in evidence-based approaches and informed by relevant theories and frameworks, such as design thinking (Brown & Wyatt, 2010), lean startup principles (Review et al., 2018), and strategic renewal strategies (Binns et al., 2014).\n\nIn conclusion, the Helpmates venture pitch presents several key strengths, including a favorable business context, a clear understanding of the target market, and a compelling value proposition. However, weaknesses related to competitive dynamics, financial strength, and implementation must be addressed for the venture to succeed. By incorporating relevant theories and frameworks, the founders can enhance their pitch and increase the likelihood of their venture's success.\n\nWord Count: 498 (excluding reference list)"}]}

Here's how it works:\n\n1. First, we define two lists: `chunk_sizes` contains the sizes of the chunks we want to create, including the sample sizes, and `sample_sizes` contains the sample sizes we want to use.\n2. We also define a list `sample_file_suffixes` that contains the suffixes to use for the sample chunk file names.\n3. We read in the CSV file using `csv.reader` and add each value to a set called `data`. This ensures that we have a unique set of values, and it also allows us to use the set method `difference_update` to remove values from the set as we generate sample and remaining chunks.\n4. For each sample size in `sample_sizes`, we create a sample of that size using the `random.sample` function and store it in a set called `sample`. We then use `difference_update` to remove the sample values from `data`.\n5. We write the sample to a JSON file with a file name based on the original CSV file name and the corresponding suffix from `sample_file_suffixes`.\n6. For each remaining chunk size in `chunk_sizes`, we create a chunk of that size using the `random.sample` function if the chunk size is less than 10000 (i.e., if it's a sample chunk), or we use the full `data` set if the chunk size is 10000 (i.e., if it's a remaining chunk).\n7. We use `difference_update` to remove the chunk values from `data`.\n8. We write the chunk to a JSON file with a file name based on the original CSV file name and the chunk number."}]}
{"timestamp": 567, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 609, "Output Length": 32, "prompt": "Erasure coding is a method of data protection and fault tolerance that involves breaking data into smaller pieces, adding redundant information, and distributing the data fragments across multiple storage locations. It is widely used in distributed systems, such as cloud storage, data centers, and in the case of Celestia, distributed blockchain networks. The primary goal of erasure coding is to ensure data reliability and availability even in the face of storage failures or data loss.\n\nHere's an in-depth description of erasure coding:\n\n1. Data Fragmentation: The original data is divided into smaller pieces, called data fragments or data shards. Each fragment contains a portion of the original data.\n2. Redundancy: Redundant fragments, called parity shards, are created by applying an algorithm, such as Reed-Solomon coding or another erasure coding scheme. Parity shards are generated using mathematical transformations or encoding functions that combine the original data shards. The number of parity shards depends on the desired level of fault tolerance and redundancy.\n3. Distribution: Both data shards and parity shards are distributed across multiple storage locations (e.g., storage nodes or disks). This distribution ensures that the data is spread across the system, reducing the impact of any single point of failure.\n4. Recovery: When data needs to be retrieved or reconstructed, a subset of the original data shards and parity shards is used. The recovery process involves decoding the available shards to regenerate the original data. As long as a sufficient number of shards (data shards and/or parity shards) are available, the original data can be reconstructed even if some of the storage locations have failed or become unavailable.\n5. Fault Tolerance: The level of fault tolerance provided by erasure coding depends on the ratio of data shards to parity shards. More parity shards result in greater fault tolerance, but at the cost of increased storage overhead. For example, with an erasure coding scheme that uses 10 data shards and 4 parity shards (often denoted as 10+4), the system can tolerate up to 4 storage failures or unavailable shards while still being able to recover the original data.\n\nErasure coding provides several benefits over traditional data replication methods, such as RAID or mirroring:\n\n* Storage Efficiency: Erasure coding generally requires less storage overhead than full replication while still providing a high level of fault tolerance.\n* Scalability: Erasure coding can be easily scaled to support large distributed systems, making it suitable for cloud storage, distributed file systems, and blockchain networks.\n* Reliability: By spreading data and parity shards across multiple storage locations, erasure coding reduces the likelihood of data loss or unavailability due to localized failures or storage issues.\n\nIn the context of Celestia, erasure coding is used to ensure data availability and fault tolerance for the transaction data submitted by rollups. By encoding and distributing the data across the network, Celestia can guarantee that the data is accessible and resilient to censorship or unavailability attacks, enabling secure and efficient data availability for rollups and other decentralized applications."}]}

You can use the @Entity and @Column annotations to map the fields of the object to the columns of the database table.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"request_data\")\npublic class RequestData {\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n  private Long id;\n\n  @Column(name = \"processor_id\")\n  private String processorId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"issuer_id\")\n  private String issuerId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"transaction_id\")\n  private String transactionId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"stepup_request_id\")\n  private String stepupRequestId;\n\n  @Column(name = \"device_locale\")\n  private String deviceLocale;\n\n  @Column(name = \"device_user_agent\")\n  private String deviceUserAgent;\n\n  @Column(name = \"message_version\")\n  private String messageVersion;\n\n  @Column(name = \"rdx_message_version\")\n  private String rdxMessageVersion;\n\n  @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n  @JoinColumn(name = \"payment_info_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\")\n  private PaymentInfo paymentInfo;\n\n  // Getters and setters\n}\n```\nNext, you can create a repository interface to handle the database operations. For example:\n```\npublic interface RequestDataRepository extends JpaRepository<RequestData, Long> {\n}\n```\nFinally, you can inject the RequestDataRepository bean into your API controller and use it to save the request data to the database.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@RestController\npublic class MyApiController {\n\n  @Autowired\n  private RequestDataRepository requestDataRepository;\n\n  @PostMapping(\"/api/request\")\n  public ResponseEntity<Object> processRequest(@RequestBody MyRequest request) {\n    // Step 02: Save the request to the database with status = 1\n    RequestData requestData = new RequestData();\n    requestData.setProcessorId(request.getProcessorId());\n    requestData.setIssuerId(request.getIssuerId());\n    requestData.setTransactionId(request.getTransactionId());\n    requestData.setStepupRequestId(request.getStepupRequestId());\n    requestData.setDeviceLocale(request.getDeviceLocale());\n    requestData.setDeviceUserAgent(request.getDeviceUserAgent());\n    requestData.setMessageVersion(request.getMessageVersion());\n    requestData.setRdxMessageVersion(request.getRdxMessageVersion());\n    requestData.setPaymentInfo(request.getPaymentInfo());\n    requestData.setStatus(1); // status = 1 indicates that the request has been received\n    requestDataRepository.save(requestData);\n  }\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!

The `arc` command takes three arguments: the start angle, the end angle, and the radius of the arc. Here, we specify the start angle as 0 (which corresponds to the positive x-axis), the end angle as 20 degrees, and the radius as 1 (which is arbitrary). The `node` command is used to add the angle label at the midpoint of the arc, using the `above right` option to position the label above and to the right of the arc, and the `midway` option to position the label at the midpoint of the arc. We use `$20^\\circ$` to typeset the degree symbol in LaTeX."}]}

His allergies were acting up, triggered by the spices and dust in the air, and he felt the telltale tickle in his nose.\n\nPhil, ever the jester, noticed Jack's discomfort and leaned over to whisper in his ear. \"You feeling alright, Jack? That nose of yours is starting to twitch.\"\n\nJack tried to play it cool, dabbing at his nose with a napkin. \"I'll be fine, Phil. It's just a little dust in the air.\"\n\nBut Phil wouldn't let up. \"Oh come on, Jack, don't hold back now. You know what they say, when you gotta sneeze, you gotta sneeze!\"\n\nPhil's wife, who had unknowingly asked for extra pepper on her food, looked up from her plate and apologized. \"Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize it would set off your allergies.\"\n\nJack's face was contorted with the effort of trying to hold back the sneeze. His eyes were watering, his nose was red, and his cheeks were puffed out. But he still tried to downplay it. \"It's no big deal, really. I've got this under control.\"\n\nPhil, however, was having none of it. \"Oh, Jack, you always do yourself a disservice. You've got the biggest sneezes of any man I know. Just let 'er rip!\"\n\nAnd with that, Jack's resolve crumbled. He let out an enormous sneeze that shook the very foundations of the hall. Plates clattered, glasses shattered, and guests shrieked in surprise. And just as everyone was recovering from the shock of that first sneeze, Jack felt another one coming on.\n\n\"Oh no,\" he muttered, but Phil was already beside him, egging him on.\n\n\"Come on, Jack, don't be shy. Give us another one!\"\n\nAnd so Jack let loose with another massive sneeze, this one even bigger than the first. The chandeliers swayed, the walls creaked, and the guests rushed for the exits. In no time at all, the once-grand banquet hall was empty and in ruins, with Jack standing in the middle of the chaos, still feeling the urge to sneeze.\n\nPhil, however, was unfazed. He clapped Jack on the back, laughing. \"You always were a showstopper, Jack. I couldn't be more proud.\""}]}

Here's the complete document as per your request:\n\nResearching Museums: An Action Plan for 4th Grade Students\n\nAs part of the 4th-grade curriculum, students are required to research and present on a specific museum. This action plan will guide students, particularly those with reading levels ranging from K-5th grade, to complete the research process effectively. This action plan uses the Big6 research process, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. Task Definition: Defining the task and identifying the questions that need to be answered.\n2. Information Seeking Strategies: Determining the sources of information needed to answer the questions.\n3. Location and Access: Finding the sources identified in step 2.\n4. Use of Information: Evaluating and extracting information from sources.\n5. Synthesis: Organizing information from different sources.\n6. Virtual Field Trips: Exploring museums virtually.\n7. Evaluation: Assessing the completed task.\n\nHere's how students can complete each step of the research process:\n\n1. Task Definition:\nAs a class, create a mind map on the board that lists all the museums students know of. Encourage students to think of museums in their town or city, as well as nationally or internationally known museums. From there, students will select a museum to research.\nMisconceptions: Students may not understand the difference between types of museums, such as art museums and science museums.\n2. Information Seeking Strategies:\nAfter selecting a museum to research, students will identify the questions they need to answer to complete their research. They will use the Destiny catalog on the PGCMLS site to locate print and digital materials, such as books and online resources, to gather information. Additionally, students can use databases like WorldBook, CultureGrams, and Encyclopaedia Britannica to find information.\nMisconceptions: Students may struggle to identify questions to ask or to identify relevant keywords to use in their research.\n3. Location and Access:\nStudents will use the resources found in step 2 to research their museum. They will take notes and record their sources.\nMisconceptions: Students may not understand how to access the information they have found.\n4. Use of Information:\nStudents will analyze and evaluate the information they have found to determine if it answers their research questions. They will take notes and record the information they found.\nMisconceptions: Students may not know how to evaluate information to determine if it is reliable or accurate.\n5. Synthesis:\nStudents will organize their notes and information into categories, such as exhibits, history, or famous artifacts. They will then write a report or create a presentation.\nMisconceptions: Students may struggle to organize their notes and information effectively.\n6. Virtual Field Trips:\nTo give students a more immersive experience, they can explore the museum virtually through websites like Google Culture, and virtual tours offered on the museum website. Additionally, students can visit museums through virtual field trips offered on sites like PebbleGo.\nMisconceptions: Students may think that virtual tours are the same as visiting a museum in person.\n7. Evaluation:\nFinally, students will evaluate their work to determine if they have met their research goals. They will assess their sources for accuracy and relevance, and determine if their final product effectively communicates what they have learned.\nMisconceptions: Students may not know how to evaluate their work effectively or may not be aware of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn conclusion, by following this action plan and using the Big6 research process, 4th-grade students can complete their museum research project with greater success. This will also help students develop important research and critical thinking skills that they will be able"}]}

Some have held the\nview that humans are exceptional in these respects,\nwhile others believe that humans and animals are\nsimilar with respect to language and thought. The issue\nis important because our self-image as a species is at\nstake. Arguments for human exceptionalism such as\nCartesian, Wittgensteinian and behaviourist state that\nlanguage and thought are closely associated, and\nanimals do not have language. The ape language\nexperiments of the 1960s and 1970s were especially\nimportant against this background: if apes could learn\nlanguage then even the advocates of human\nexceptionalism would have to admit that they have\nthoughts. It is now generally believed that whatever\nlinguistic abilities apes have shown have been quite\nrudimentary. Yet many sceptics are willing to grant that\nin some cases apes did develop linguistic skills to some\nextent, and clearly evidenced thought. Studies of other\nanimals in captivity and various animals in the wild have\nprovided evidence of highly sophisticated\ncommunicative behaviour. Cognitive ethology and\ncomparative psychology have emerged as the fields that\nstudy animal thought.

Yes, basically, the Tiamat field caused USA and Canada to become third world countries overnight, and to lose massive amounts of population to sudden death caused by the immediate EMP ( crashes, hospital deaths etc. ), and then to mass migration, food shortages in the cities etc. So the US and Canadian governments still exist, but their influence is very limited in the remaining cities which weren't immediately ruined by the EMP. Alaska has formed its own government which only nominally continues the USA sovereignty, but in the subsequent elections, the ruling parties in Alaska are anti-migration, and mostly ( de facto ) fascist. The wave of almost 250 million refugees and migrants from USA has caused the government of Mexico to fall, and the local militias to form their own independent governments which are basically all fascist and ruthless towards migrants from the USA. The rest of Latin America has suffered from these events economically, so there was a domino effect, and most of the governments have become fascist or totalitarian. \n\nEuropean countries have also gone to extremes because of the large influx of refugees, and the countries which most relied on USA for economy had suffered massive economic crisis ( Ireland, UK, Germany etc. help me with some data pls ). Russia has become a more central player during these events, but with the outside pressure of USA faltering, the local Russian politicians have become more ambitious and disunited ( without a strong enemy, there was no need for a one strong leader in Russia ), so this caused Russia and many ex-USSR countries to become semi-independent from Moscow. Japan had also suffered economically, so China quickly took over Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam ( only nominally leaving them as a sovereign nations ). \nBased on your outline, it's clear that the Tiamat event has had profound global consequences, leading to a shift in power dynamics and the rise of extremist governments. Here are some additional details and world-building elements to consider:\n\nEconomic Impact on European Countries: The sudden collapse of the US and Canadian economies would have had a ripple effect on their trading partners. Countries with strong economic ties to the US and Canada, like the UK, Germany, and Ireland, would have experienced severe financial crises. This could result in high unemployment rates, currency devaluation, and increased poverty.\n\nOther European countries might also experience similar issues, with some nations becoming more isolationist or nationalist in response to the crisis. The European Union could struggle to maintain unity among its member states, and its influence might wane as individual countries focus on their own interests and survival.\n\nAfrican and Middle Eastern Countries: The shift in global power dynamics could lead to increased instability in Africa and the Middle East. As the US and other Western powers lose their influence, regional powers may rise and compete for dominance. This could lead to new alliances, rivalries, and conflicts over resources and territory.\n\nIndia and Southeast Asia: The power vacuum created by the collapse of the US and the rise of China could also impact India and Southeast Asia. India might assert itself as a regional power to counterbalance China's growing influence, leading to increased tensions and potential conflicts between the two nations. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore could experience political and economic turmoil as they navigate the new geopolitical landscape.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand: Given their geographic isolation, Australia and New Zealand might fare better than other nations in terms of political stability. However, they would still be affected by the global economic downturn and would need to forge new alliances and trade partnerships to maintain their prosperity.\n\nClimate Change and Environmental Issues: With the chaos and upheaval caused by the Tiamat event, global efforts to address climate change and other environmental issues could be severely hampered. This might lead to worsening environmental conditions and more frequent natural disasters, further compounding the challenges faced by the survivors of the Tiamat event.\n\nThese additional details and considerations can help you further develop your post-apocalyptic world, highlighting the complex global consequences of the Tiamat event and creating a rich, immersive setting for your novel.\n\n\nPetar B\n8. inside the Tiamat field, the nature took over cities and human settlements. Animals are unaffected by the field, and many humans survived / returned to the zone, basically living without electricity, sort of like the Amish, or people in the XIX century. But these agricultural settlements are often attacked by the technologically advanced polities from the east and west coast and former Mexico. There are also raiders who live inside the tiamat field, using whatever weapons they can use, older cars ( which are less reliable, as the field seems to mess with sparkplugs ). After almost a century of this field's existence, the animals have multiplied, the forests are thick and the temperature inside the zone had fallen a few degrees. Unpredictable storms often hit the area, and earthquakes are much more common, even in the coastal areas unaffected by the EMP blast. The Tiamat entity also seems to attract tides, so the sea levels have risen in the coastal areas, and the surviving cities suffer greatly, and are often flooded, so they are slowly faltering.\nThe Tiamat field has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the environment and the people living within and around it. Here are some elements to consider based on the changes you've described:\n\nFlora: As nature reclaims the areas within the Tiamat field, forests and vegetation become denser, and previously cultivated land returns to its wild state. This could lead to the emergence of new plant species or the resurgence of native plants that had been previously displaced by human activity.\n\nFauna: The absence of humans and the proliferation of plant life would lead to an increase in animal populations within the Tiamat field. This might result in the resurgence of previously endangered species and the emergence of new or mutated species adapted to the altered environment. There could also be an increase in predator populations due to the abundance of prey.\n\nHuman settlements: The communities living within the Tiamat field would be forced to adapt to a pre-electric lifestyle, relying on traditional farming techniques, animal labor, and manual craftsmanship. They would need to develop new ways to defend themselves against attacks from technologically advanced polities and raiders, perhaps using ingenious low-tech solutions, traps, or guerrilla tactics.\n\nWeather patterns and natural disasters: The unpredictable storms, increased frequency of earthquakes, and altered tides caused by the Tiamat field would pose significant challenges for the people living in and around the affected areas. These communities might develop unique architectural solutions, such as stilt houses, floating structures, or buildings designed to withstand earthquakes and floods. They might also rely on traditional methods of predicting weather patterns and coping with natural disasters.\n\nSea level rise and coastal cities: As the Tiamat entity causes tides to rise and coastal areas to flood, the surviving cities would face increasing challenges to their infrastructure and resources. They might invest in building sea walls, levees, and other flood mitigation measures, or they might resort to relocating further inland as the situation becomes untenable. These cities would also need to adapt to a world with limited resources and unstable trade networks, making them more self-reliant and resourceful.\n\nConsidering these factors will help you develop a rich, detailed world that reflects the long-term effects of the Tiamat field on the environment and its inhabitants."}]}

So, they decided to explore the local cafe scene and try some of the delicious food that Europe was famous for.\n\nAs they walked into the quaint cafe, they were greeted by the warm, inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee and delicious pastries. They chose a small table in the corner, and Jack ordered a cappuccino while Phil went for a latte. They were just settling in and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere when they noticed a woman, Lyonne, at a nearby table.\n\nLyonne was a striking woman, with dark hair and bright, sparkling eyes.

Here's an example of how the underlying relationship issues could play out in the context of a relationship between two people:\n\nCase Study:\n\nJohn is a 36-year-old male from Ireland with ADHD, and his partner, Anna, is a 28-year-old German woman with ADHD. Anna is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Behavioral Economics with a view to completing a PhD and eventually finding work on the job market. John has spent much of his life pursuing a career in music, but has struggled to get off the ground and has since developed a successful career in conceptual design, which allows him to be financially stable and pursue his passion for creating music in his free time.\n\nCommunication problems:\n\nJohn and Anna have struggled with communication issues in their relationship. John often feels that Anna is not fully present when they talk, and that she is distracted by her studies or other obligations. Anna, in turn, feels that John can be too intense and demanding in their conversations, and that he does not always listen to her needs and concerns.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on improving their communication skills by setting aside dedicated time for conversations, actively listening to each other, and expressing themselves clearly and effectively. They may also benefit from learning to respond with empathy and understanding, and making an effort to focus on each other's needs and concerns during their conversations.\n\nTrust issues:\n\nJohn has struggled with trust issues in the relationship, due in part to past experiences of being betrayed by previous partners. He sometimes feels suspicious of Anna's interactions with other men, and has difficulty trusting that she is fully committed to their relationship.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on rebuilding trust by being open and transparent with each other, avoiding behaviors that may trigger mistrust, and making a commitment to honesty and integrity. They may also benefit from discussing their fears and concerns in a safe and supportive environment, and working to find ways to build trust and strengthen their connection.\n\nPower struggles:\n\nJohn and Anna have also struggled with power struggles in their relationship. John sometimes feels that Anna is not supportive enough of his musical ambitions, and that she does not fully understand his needs and priorities. Anna, in turn, feels that John can be too demanding and controlling at times, and that he does not always listen to her needs and concerns.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work to address power imbalances by actively listening to each other's needs and concerns, setting clear boundaries, and working to make decisions collaboratively. They may also benefit from exploring any underlying fears or insecurities that may be driving power struggles, and finding ways to build a more equal and supportive relationship.\n\nExternal pressures:\n\nBoth John and Anna are dealing with external stressors in their lives. John is trying to balance his day job as a product design consultant with his passion for music, and Anna is under pressure to complete her Master's degree and prepare for her future career.\n\nSolution:\n\nJohn and Anna could work on managing external stressors by supporting each other and finding ways to prioritize their relationship in the midst of competing demands. They may also benefit from setting aside dedicated time for each other and engaging in stress-reducing activities together, such as exercise, mindfulness, or other self-care practices.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBy working to address these underlying relationship issues, John and Anna could develop a stronger and more fulfilling relationship. They could also benefit from seeking the support of a couples therapist, who could provide them with guidance and support as they work to strengthen their connection and build a more balanced and sustainable partnership."}]}

He has a lovable, goofy expression on his face and wears a pair of oversized glasses to help him see. He also wears a pair of oversized boots with extra cushioning to protect his ankles from the frequent falls he takes.\n\nRole: Klutzy is a clumsy, yet lovable support champion who excels at providing utility and protection for his allies.\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive - Clumsy: Klutzy has a 10% chance to trip and fall whenever he takes damage from an enemy champion, causing him to become briefly slowed and vulnerable for 1.5 seconds. However, this also causes him to drop a trail of helpful items, such as health potions, gold coins, and wards, for his allies to pick up. The number of items dropped increases with Klutzy's level.\n\nQ - Fumble: Klutzy throws a clumsy punch at an enemy, dealing 60/80/100/120/140 (+0.6 bonus attack damage) physical damage and briefly slowing them by 20% for 1 second. If the punch misses, Klutzy has a 20% chance to stumble and fall, causing him to become slowed and unable to attack for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds\n\nMana cost: 50/55/60/65/70\n\nW - Wild Swings: Klutzy becomes nearsighted and begins swinging his arms wildly, dealing 50/70/90/110/130 (+0.4 bonus attack damage) physical damage to all enemies within a small radius. While using this ability, Klutzy's movement speed is increased by 125 for the duration.\n\nDuration: 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds\n\nCooldown: 18/16/14/12/10 seconds\n\nMana cost: 70/80/90/100/110\n\nE - Slip n' Slide: Klutzy charges forward, sliding across the ground and leaving a slick surface behind him. Enemy champions who are caught in the slick surface have a 20% chance to slip and fall, becoming slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds\n\nMana cost: 60/65/70/75/80\n\nR - Pratfall: Klutzy takes a massive stumble, causing him to fall to the ground and become slowed by 20% for 1.5 seconds. However, this also creates a large shockwave that knocks up and slows all enemy champions in a large radius by 20% for 1.5 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 120/110/100 seconds\n\nMana cost: 100/110/120\n\nOverall, Klutzy is a clumsy, yet lovable champion who excels at providing utility and protection for his allies. While his clumsiness can sometimes get him into trouble, it also creates opportunities for his allies to capitalize on and turn the tide of the battle in their favor."}]}

This implementation covers most of the constructs mentioned. However, due to the size and complexity of the task, some aspects such as error handling and reporting are simplified.

The `ParseError` enum represents various types of parse errors that may occur.\n\nFor each language construct, you'll need to implement parsing functions that consume input characters and construct the corresponding AST nodes. Due to space constraints, I have not provided implementations for all parsing functions here.\n\nFor example, you could implement parsing functions for literals like this:\n```rust\nfn parse_number(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_string(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn parse_boolean(&mut self) -> ParseResult<Literal> {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nSimilarly, you'll need to implement parsing functions for other constructs like identifiers, operators, expressions, control structures, function and class definitions, function calls, and modules and imports.\n\nTo handle and report syntax errors, you can use the `ParseError` enum and return a `ParseResult` from each parsing function. You can improve the error handling and reporting by including more context, such as line and column numbers, and more specific error messages.\n\nFinally, the `parse_program` method serves as the parser entry point, parsing the entire LMLang source code into an AST. The `parse` function is provided as a convenient top-level function for parsing LMLang source code.\n\nKeep in mind that this basic implementation should be extended and improved to cover the entire LMLang syntax, handle error reporting better, and ensure correct precedence and associativity for operators."}]}

{"timestamp": 1251, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 767, "Output Length": 79, "prompt": "Certainly! Here is a revised version that combines the three sections into one coherent story:\n\nThe mirror arrived in the United States from England, where it had a long and mysterious history. Two middle-aged Englishmen were responsible for packing the mirror for shipment. One of them was all business, while the other liked to talk. As they worked, the talkative man commented on the beauty of the mirror, and the other man replied, \"It's just a mirror, mate. Let's just pack it up and send it on its way.\"\n\nTwo decades later, the mirror was discovered in a storeroom of a New York museum. The employees who found it were surprised to learn that the museum had owned the mirror for many years, and yet it had never been put on display. \"It's not really art, is it?\" one of the employees remarked. \"It's just a mirror.\" But even though it was not considered art, the mirror seemed to draw people to it.\n\nThe employees were curious about the mirror's origin, and they discussed its history in hushed tones. They knew that it had come from England, but beyond that, they knew very little. \"I heard that the person who owned it claimed it could show you an alternate future,\" one of the employees said. \"Can you imagine? Seeing what might have been?\"\n\nAnother employee chimed in, \"I heard that it was cursed, that anyone who looked into it would be trapped there forever. But I don't believe in that sort of thing.\" The employees all laughed nervously, but they couldn't deny the magnetic pull of the mirror.\n\nOne of the employees, a middle-aged woman named Anne, was particularly intrigued by the mirror. Her son, a teenage boy, would often come to the museum after school to wait for her to finish her shift. Anne noticed that her son would often sit in front of the mirror, staring at his reflection for long periods of time. She didn't understand why he found the mirror so compelling, but she couldn't deny its power.\n\nAs the days passed, the mirror seemed to exert an increasingly strong hold on the boy. Anne began to worry about his mental health and wondered if the mirror was somehow causing him harm. She decided to do some research on the mirror's history and was shocked by what she found.\n\nThe mirror had a long and dark past, dating back centuries to medieval Europe. There were stories of people becoming obsessed with the mirror, of seeing their own reflection twisted and distorted until it drove them mad. Some people claimed that the mirror was cursed, that it had the power to show people a version of reality that was not meant to be seen.\n\nAnne became convinced that the mirror was the cause of her son's strange behavior. She begged her supervisors to remove the mirror from the museum, but they refused, claiming that it was a valuable artifact with an important history. Anne knew that she had to take matters into her own hands.\n\nOne day, when the museum was closed, Anne snuck into the storage room where the mirror was kept. She wrapped it in a thick blanket and began to carry it out of the museum. As she was leaving, she ran into one of the security guards. He asked her what she was doing, and she replied, \"I'm taking the mirror home. It doesn't belong here.\"\n\nThe security guard tried to stop her, but Anne was determined. She carried the mirror out of the museum and into the night, never looking back. When she got home, she placed the mirror in a wooden box and locked it away in her attic.\n\nYears went by, and Anne's son grew up and moved away. The mirror remained locked away in the attic, gathering dust and cobwebs. Anne never forgot about the mirror and its strange power,"}]}

Meanwhile newspapers have described the documentary series as the couple's war on the royals.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Harry and Meghan are officially known, stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to forge new lives in the United States away from media harassment, which the couple said had threatened to destroy their mental health.\n\n\"I wonder what would have happened to us had we not got out when we did,\" Harry says in a trailer. \"I said 'we need to get out of here',\" he adds, describing their exit as the \"freedom flight\".\n\nHOSTILE PRESS\n\nWhile the couple have won awards and plaudits from some across the Atlantic for their charitable and human rights work, back in Britain a hostile press accuses them of seeking to make millions from their royal status while constantly attacking the monarchy.\n\nNewspapers have also cited former unnamed royal aides challenging the couple's narrative in the documentaries, saying there were inaccuracies in their accounts.\n\nBoth Buckingham Palace and William's office, Kensington Palace, have said they would not be commenting on the documentaries.\n\nA royal source also said neither the palace nor representatives of William or other royals had been approached for comment for the series itself, contradicting a Netflix statement that said they had declined to comment.\n\nAccording to initial figures cited by the BBC, some 2.4 million viewers in Britain watched the first episode on the day it was released, although the senior royals themselves have steered clear, royal sources have told newspapers.\n\nHours after the final three episodes are made available at 8am in Britain, Charles, his wife Camilla, Prince William and his wife Kate along with other royals will attend a carol service at London's Westminster Abbey to \"recognise the selfless efforts of individuals, families and communities across the UK\".\n\nThe service will also be dedicated to the late Queen Elizabeth, whose funeral was held in the Abbey in September."}]}

Through this program, we offer intensive bootcamps and other courses to individuals at a lower cost, with the goal of increasing the pool of talented workers available to the industry.\n\nWe also plan to monetize our data through partnerships with other companies and organizations in the talent development industry. By providing access to our large and diverse pool of student data, we can help other businesses improve their talent transformation processes and provide more personalized and effective training to their own employees.\n\n2-a) Market size\n\nTo estimate the market size for our talent transformation platform, we must consider both the global adult education market and the job market. According to market research firm HolonIQ, the global market for education and training is estimated to be worth $7 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, the global job market is expected to grow to 3.5 billion workers by 2030, with an increasing demand for workers with digital skills.\n\nAssuming that our talent transformation platform can capture just 1% of the global market for education and training, and assuming an average cost of $5,000 per student, our potential revenue could reach $35 billion. However, given our focus on B2B and our unique capabilities in talent transformation, we believe we have the potential to capture a larger share of the market and generate even more revenue.\n\n2-b-i) Status, pros and cons of other players in the market\n\nWhen it comes to talent development and incubation, there are a number of players in the market, ranging from global educational platforms to career transformation platforms like LinkedIn. Some of the key players in the market include:\n\n* Udacity: A leading online education platform with a focus on tech skills and digital transformation. Udacity offers a variety of programs and courses designed to upskill workers and prepare them for the jobs of the future.\n* Coursera: Another popular online education platform that offers a wide range of courses and programs in various fields. Coursera partners with universities and companies to provide high-quality education to learners around the world.\n* LinkedIn: A career-focused social media platform that offers a variety of tools and resources for job seekers and professionals. LinkedIn also provides learning opportunities and certification programs to help workers upskill and stay competitive in the job market.\n\nEach of these players has their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Udacity has a strong focus on tech skills and digital transformation, but may not have the same level of experience and expertise in talent development as Codestates. Coursera has a wide range of courses and partnerships, but may not have the same level of customization and personalization as Codestates. LinkedIn has a large and active user base, but may not have the same level of in-depth training and evaluation as Codestates.\n\n2-b-ii) Competitive advantage of Codestates\n\nCodestates has a number of competitive advantages in the talent development and incubation market, including:\n\n* Unique student data: Codestates has been collecting student data for many years, which provides a wealth of insights into the competencies and potential of digital workers. This data can be used to develop more accurate and effective competency evaluation models, as well as personalized training programs.\n* Personalized education curriculum: Codestates offers a wide variety of modularized contents that can be"}]}

{"timestamp": 1401, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1642, "Output Length": 83, "prompt": "what is the sentiment of the following paragraph. In my opinion, it all starts with building trust. Trust is the foundation of any successful friendship, or relationship, and it requires both the persons to be willing to invest in the relationship. It is an attribute that is hard to gain, but easy to lose. Having trust in a relationship means that you and your friend are being honest, reliable and open to communication with each other.\n\nIt also requires being willing to forgive and accept mistakes, and to be understanding and supportive of each other in times of need. When trust is established in any relationship, it flourishes and provides a safe space to both persons to share freely and openly, without being judgemental. Through this openness and honesty, both friends can build a stronger understanding and appreciation of each other.\n\nWhat is trust?\n\nTrust is a fundamental element of any relationship, and it\u2019s essential for building strong relationships. It is the belief that the other person will be honest and reliable, and that he/she will respect your interests at heart. When you trust someone, you feel safe and confident in their presence, and you know that you can rely on them in times of need. It\u2019s important to note that trust is not something that can be taken for granted. It must be earned over time, through consistent and honest communication.\n\nTrust is also an important component of self-esteem. When we trust ourselves and our decisions, we are more likely to take risks and pursue our dreams. Trusting ourselves also allows us to be more open and more confident with those around us and in return, we gain others\u2019 confidence in us.\n\nThe benefits of building lasting trust\n\nWhen you trust someone, you know that you will have their back in difficult times, and you can be sure that they are being honest and reliable. This level of support can be incredibly valuable in times of hardship and it can provide a sense of security and reassurance. But keep in mind that trust is built in the long term, it is not a one-day story.\n\nHave you noticed your mum or your dad telling you that they are having a meet-up with their college or school friends? Well kids, it is the trust in friendship that made their bond/relationship stronger, which made it possible for their years\u2019 old friendship to sail smoothly even to this day.\n\nSo, let\u2019s follow some steps to build lasting friendships, based on trust.\n\nBe honest and reliable\n\nHonesty is the foundation of trust. It\u2019s important to be truthful and consistent in your words and actions, and to be open and willing to communicate about difficult topics. No matter what happens or how much it costs you, you must maintain honesty.\n\nIf you or your friend does something wrong to one another, or some bad feelings have developed between you two, try to clear things up immediately. Make sure that you do not hate the person for their deed, you actually dislike the deed. So be honest in giving your opinion. Let your friend know that you are a trustworthy person and you want to clear things up and not create a drama.\n\nHowever, if you are at fault, it will be embarrassing for you to express your fault. But remember, true friendship needs honesty. Therefore, express and explain yourself if he/she wants you to, otherwise a simple apology may work.\n\nIllustration by Aamnah Arshad\nForgive and move on after a mistake\n\nMistakes are inevitable in any relationship, and it\u2019s important to be willing to forgive and accept them. This requires letting go of anger and resentment, and being willing to move forward in the relationship. Either you may be at fault or your friend, just let it go.\n\nBut if you can\u2019t, then explain and resolve the matter. However, keep in mind that while you may immediately be ready to accept your fault, your friend will likely have bad feelings towards you, and will need time to get over it and return to normal. Everyone needs space and time to think and process things. Give a little time for emotions to cool down, for the feeling of hurt or anger to subside, then better sense will prevail.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that mistakes can be learning opportunities. You can avoid them next time and be more careful in maintaining a healthy relationship. Once the mistake has been discussed, it\u2019s important to talk about how to move forward. This could involve making a commitment to be more honest and reliable, or to be more understanding and supportive. It could also involve setting boundaries, or taking steps to make up for the mistake.\n\nSay what you mean, and mean what you say!\n\nDon\u2019t say things that you are not sure about. It will only detach your friend and weaken your image; you will be considered someone with no dignity of keeping their words or someone who doesn\u2019t mean what they say.\n\nListen and be supportive\n\nListening is an important part of communication. Active listening involves paying attention to the other person, understanding their point of view, and providing feedback that shows you\u2019ve heard and understood them. And if you think your friend needs your support or help, don\u2019t hesitate.\n\nFor instance, your friend needs some notes or stationary item, but feels embarrassed asking for help, thinking that he/she might be expecting a lot, or it might bother you. In such a situation, always consider the nature of your friend, help and support them before they feel the need to ask you. Let your friend know that they are more important in your life than material things.\n\nHowever, sometimes, there are things that are not in your capacity to help out. At that time, moral support is the key to building a strong relationship and gaining trust. Let your friend know that you are always there to help them out, even when it\u2019s not in your capacity.\n\nBe appreciative\n\nAppreciation is a key part of any friendship. It can involve something as simple as saying thank you, or taking the time to appreciate the little things your friend does for you. Or when they are doing well in studies, or whatever achievements they tell you about, just appreciate their actions and encourage them.\n\nOne of the ways to show appreciation to your friend is supporting their goals and ideas, and encouraging them. Your friend will notice your positive feedback and gradually build a strong trust in you.\n\nAvoid criticism\n\nCriticism is good as long as it is constructive, positive and boosts one\u2019s confidence to move forward, not something which discourages and pulls one down. A healthy friendship should involve supportive feedback and constructive criticism. Unhealthy friendships often involve constant criticism, which ruin any relationship in no time. Remember no one wants a friend who is always criticising, always picking out things to demotivate and discourage them.\n\nBe open\n\nOpen communication is important for building strong trust in friendship. It helps prevent misunderstandings and conflicts; it also makes it easier to resolve any complex issues that arise.\n\nBeing open to your friend means being honest about your thoughts and feelings, and being willing to confront difficult and sensitive topics. It also involves being willing to listen to the other person\u2019s perspective, and all this while being more understanding and supportive.\n\nKeep a secret, secret\n\nMany people don\u2019t keep their friends\u2019 personal stuff to themselves. Instead, they tell everyone. Remember, your friend has trusted you while telling you something. How would you feel if you heard others discussing your matters which you had only told your friend? Won\u2019t you feel deceived and betrayed? Right, so learn to keep things to yourself. This is also the basis of maintaining trust and keeping the friendship stronger.\n\nRemember kids, trust is the foundation of any strong friendship. Without trust, a friendship can easily crumble and fall apart. Building trust in friendship is a process that takes time and effort. It not only requires both persons to be open and honest with each other, but also to be supportive and dependable. This means being there for each other when times are tough, and being able to rely on one another when needed. It also means being supportive and encouraging of each other\u2019s goals and ambitions.\n\nBuilding trust takes time, sometime longer than you may have expected, but it is worth it in the end."}]}

Here's a general overview of how you can do it:\n\n1. Use `walkdir` to recursively traverse the directory tree and collect information about all files. You can use `fs::metadata` to get file metadata such as size and modification time.\n2. Serialize the collected information into a JSON string using `serde`. You can use a struct to represent each file's metadata and path, and then use `serde_json::to_string` to convert the struct into a JSON string.\n3. Use `sled` to create a key-value store and store the JSON strings under their corresponding filenames. `sled` is a fast and efficient key-value store that can handle large datasets.\n4. Use `sled` to perform searches by querying the key-value store with the search term. You can use `sled::Tree::scan_prefix` to efficiently scan through all keys that match a given prefix, which can be used to implement substring matching.\n5. Deserialize the JSON strings to retrieve the file metadata and path.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the indexing code:\n```rust\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\nuse std::time::SystemTime;\n\nuse walkdir::WalkDir;\n\nuse serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]\nstruct FileMetadata {\n    size: u64,\n    modified: SystemTime,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]\nstruct FileIndex {\n    path: PathBuf,\n    metadata: FileMetadata,\n}\n\nfn index_files(path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let tree = sled::open(\"file_index.db\")?;\n\n    for entry in WalkDir::new(path) {\n        let entry = entry?;\n        if entry.file_type().is_file() {\n            let path = entry.path().to_owned();\n            let metadata = entry.metadata()?;\n            let file_metadata = FileMetadata {\n                size: metadata.len(),\n                modified: metadata.modified()?,\n            };\n            let file_index = FileIndex {\n                path,\n                metadata: file_metadata,\n            };\n            let json = serde_json::to_string(&file_index)?;\n            let filename = entry.file_name().to_string_lossy().to_string();\n            tree.insert(filename, json)?;\n        }\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nfn search_files(query: &str) -> Result<Vec<FileIndex>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let tree = sled::open(\"file_index.db\")?;\n    let mut results = Vec::new();\n\n    for (filename, json) in tree.scan_prefix(query) {\n        let file_index: FileIndex = serde_json::from_str(&json)?;\n        results.push(file_index);\n    }\n\n    Ok(results)\n}\n```\nHere's an example of how to use the indexing code to perform a search:\n```rust\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    index_files(\".\")?;\n\n    let results = search_files(\"example\")?;\n    for result in results {\n        println!(\"{:?}\", result);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\nNote that this is just an example implementation and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

In this case, the hyperparameters being searched are` learning\\_rate`,` n\\_estimators`, and` max\\_depth`.\n\n76. The grid search is performed using the `GridSearchCV` class from the `scikit-learn` library.\n77. The `GridSearchCV` class performs a cross-validated grid search over the specified hyperparameter search space.\n78. The best set of hyperparameters is then found by training the model with different hyperparameter combinations and selecting the combination with the best performance.\n79. The best hyperparameters can then be accessed using the `best_params_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV` object.\n80. In this example, the grid search is performed with a 5-fold cross-validation, meaning that the data is divided into 5 parts, and the model is trained and evaluated 5 times, with each part serving as the test set once.\n81. This helps to ensure that the best hyperparameters are selected in a robust way, by averaging the performance across multiple training and testing splits.\n82. LightGBM also provides a number of other tools for model training and evaluation, such as early stopping, cross-validation, and feature importance evaluation.\n83. These tools can be used to further improve the performance and robustness of a LightGBM model.\n84. To conclude, LightGBM is a powerful and flexible gradient boosting library that provides many useful features for model training, tuning, and evaluation.\n85. Its fast training speed, ability to handle large datasets and sparse data, and rich set of tools for model interpretation make it a popular choice among data scientists.\n86. If you're working on a machine learning problem and are looking for a gradient boosting solution, LightGBM is definitely worth considering.\n87. Here is another example of how to use LightGBM to build a gradient boosting model and evaluate its performance in Python:\n```python\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# split the data into training and testing sets\ntrain_features, test_features, train_target, test_target = train_test_split(\n    data.drop(\"target\", axis=1), data[\"target\"], test_size=0.2\n)\n\n# create a LightGBM model\nmodel = lgb.LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=3)\n\n# train the model on the training data\nmodel.fit(train_features, train_target)\n\n# make predictions on the testing data\npredictions = model.predict(test_features)\n\n# evaluate the model's performance using accuracy\naccuracy = accuracy_score(test_target, predictions)\nprint(\"Accuracy: {:.2f}%\".format(accuracy * 100))\n```\n88. In this example, the data is first split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `scikit-learn` library.\n89. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.\n90. The `LGBMClassifier` class is used"}]}

But recently he changed his mind.\n\n\u201cWe will be reunited soon, but unlike at first, Singapore is no longer a transit country for our son, but a permanent home,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nThe couple are part of a new wave of Chinese immigration and investment in Singapore, which is becoming a magnet for professionals and the wealthy amid economic and social problems at home, according to interviews with consultants, investors and immigrants.\nBut growing interest in Singapore could spell bad news for the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. Wealth emigration is beginning to take a toll, with 10,000 wealthy Chinese packing up and leaving the mainland this year and 3,000 leaving Hong Kong, Henley & Partners estimated.\n\nThere has also been a sharp uptick in investment migration enquiries and applications.\n\nBy the end of the second quarter, more than 66 per cent of web enquiries from East Asia to Henley & Partners were from Chinese nationals, and Chinese enquiries increased by 134 per cent in the second quarter from the previous three months.\n\nThe most eye-catching Chinese immigrants to Singapore are wealthy entrepreneurs, who are setting up family offices in the city, said Joylin Su, an executive at an asset-management firm typically serving rich families.\n\nMore than 700 family offices were established in Singapore in 2021, and the figure was just 50 in 2018, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nA family office typically refers to a legal entity that carries out the administration and management of assets and investments of ultra-high-net-worth individuals or families for the purposes of capital preservation, succession planning, and managing investments.\n\nMAS approved more than 100 applications to set up single-family offices in the first four months of the year. Assets under management in Singapore grew from S$4.7 trillion last year to S$5.4 trillion this year, according to MAS.\n\nAnd more than 600 applications are awaiting approval, Su added, with each fund worth at least S$20 million yuan.\n\nOver half of these are from rich Chinese families, including those who have stored their wealth in Hong Kong over the past few years, she said.\n\n\u201cIt used to take about four months but now it takes up to 18 months to set up a family office in Singapore,\u201d Su said, adding that applications have surged from previous years.\n\n\u201cSingapore has maintained a good balance between East and West, which makes it outstanding among the list of destinations for wealthy families to move from the mainland.\n\n\u201cIts clear tax system also makes the rich from across the world feel safe for wealth management.\u201d\n\nHowever, the surge in wealthy immigrants and talent may raise discussions domestically about taxation, including on property or inheritance, said Su, especially as the cost of living is soaring.\n\nSavvy investors are rushing to exploit business opportunities serving the new arrivals.\n\nA large number of professionals with experience working for fund management companies in China are moving to Singapore, Su said.\n\nPrivate money transfer services in Singapore, like Zhongguo Remittance, are offering better exchange rates than banks\u2019 official rates, showing strong demand for local currency among Chinese newcomers.\n\nVIP clubs catering to Chinese are also mushrooming across Singapore, which is already home to scores of swanky wine bars and cocktail lounges charging top dollar.\n\n\u201cA newly established club required each member to pay S$50,000 for expensive wine and cigars as a threshold, and 50 seats were snapped up on the opening day,\u201d Su said.\n\n\u201cLocals in Singapore drink whiskey and wine, but the demand for Mao-tai in these clubs and fine restaurants has risen sharply to quench the nostalgia of these wealthy Chinese.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s total population, which includes non-residents, grew 3.4 per cent year on year to 5.64 million in 2022, according to official figures.\n\nThe number of Singaporean citizens rose 1.6 per cent to 3.55 million while the non-resident population, including workers and students, climbed 6.6 per cent to 1.56 million, according to the Department of Statistics.\n\nSingapore\u2019s status as an international tech hub \u2013 especially for the rapidly growing Southeast Asia market \u2013 has long made it appealing to workers in the fintech and IT industries.\n\nMost Chinese students studying at Singapore universities are looking to stay, drawn by the stable political environment, competitive salaries and reasonable income tax, said Mei Lingchuan, an IT professional with experience in California who is now studying for an MBA in Singapore.\n\n\u201cMany of our Chinese alumni who graduated in previous years actually want to come back to work and live here,\u201d he said.\n\nAlfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said China\u2019s stringent virus curbs explained why many were looking to leave China.\n\n\u201cThe direct motivation of the relocations, as far as I know, is that people want to avoid the impact of COVID restrictions on their daily work and life,\u201d Wu said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s other appeals include the fact that Mandarin is widely spoken, there is a quality education system and easier access for tech sector workers, said Wu.\n\n\u201cThe Singapore government favours a certain type of people \u2013 technology talents. It has announced an extended tech visa to lure tech workers. I think people in the tech sector have a better chance to settle down in Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\nStarting next September, Singapore will offer a five-year visa for tech industry jobs, an extension from the two to three year permits currently available, according to the Ministry of Manpower."}]}

Miko wears a unique and stylized variation of clothing inspired by the colors of a shrine priestess' traditional outfit. She wears a golden head accessory accompanied by matching golden earrings. The right earring contains an Electro Inazuman Vision wrapped in a complex drop-shaped piece and decorated by a small fan-shaped accessory at the bottom. The earrings are attached to her ears by diamond-shaped studs.\n\nBeing a kitsune, Miko also has a fox form, although she refuses to reveal it to the Filon.\n\nMiko has a mysterious demeanor around her whenever she assumes her duties as the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine.

She has an enigmatic air around her, with her friends growing used to it.[3] When speaking with outsiders or close friends, she shows a blunter and more cynical side to her. Miko does not mince words, even towards her friend and master Ei. Being a kitsune, Miko is fond of fried tofu. She despises pickled foods of all sorts.\n\nAs a kitsune and youkai, she's very mischievous, including in her roles as Guuji and owner of Yae Publishing House. She couples this mischievous streak with impressive skills of manipulation and reading people.

Though in typical fashion for her, she quickly turns the Traveler and Paimon's sympathy into opportunity to trick them into paying for an expensive dinner.

My achievements in related subjects, including a full score of 800 in SAT Math, a 100 in pre-calculus 12, and a 97 in Physics 11, reflect my dedication and hard work. Additionally, I have earned a score of 5 in AP Calculus (AB) and plan to attend AP Calculus (BC) and AP Physics 1, as well as AP Physics C to further enhance my understanding of theoretical physics and mathematics.\n\nBeyond the classroom, I have pursued extracurricular activities that have helped me deepen my understanding of physics. As the President and Founder of the school tennis club, I have developed leadership and organizational skills, while participating in the UBC rowing and tennis clubs has allowed me to maintain a healthy lifestyle and develop a strong work ethic. I am also an accomplished paper-folder, and my photography has been featured in personal exhibitions at school.\n\nVolunteering for Joyce Murray, the Member of Parliament for Vancouver Quadra, has given me an opportunity to engage with my community and develop a deeper understanding of politics and governance. Furthermore, my involvement as the Chief IT of Art of Our Community, a student-led and founded organization working to utilize art to reinvigorate and rejuvenate local Vancouver communities through art-based projects, has given me an opportunity to apply my technical skills to a meaningful cause.\n\nMy passion for physics and engineering is driven by my desire to make a positive impact on the world. Pursuing a post-secondary education in STEM majors, particularly in fields like engineering, will allow me to develop my skills and knowledge and pursue research opportunities in these fields.\n\nPhysics and engineering are closely related fields that share a deep interconnection. Engineers rely heavily on the concepts and principles of physics to design, build, and optimize technologies and systems. My ambition is to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative and meaningful solutions to real-world challenges.\n\nIn the next five years, I hope to be studying at a top-tier university, expanding my knowledge of engineering and physics, and developing my skills through research opportunities. In the next ten years, I envision myself making a positive impact in the world through my work in engineering and physics, contributing to groundbreaking innovations that transform society.\n\nAttending ISSYP would be an exciting opportunity for me to expand my knowledge, deepen my understanding of theoretical physics, and gain exposure to cutting-edge research and applications in the field. The collaboration between physicists and engineers often leads to groundbreaking innovations that transform society. For example, the development of semiconductors, which are crucial components of modern electronics, was made possible by the collaboration of physicists and engineers. The creation of the internet, which has revolutionized communication and information exchange, was also a result of collaboration between physicists and engineers.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that attending ISSYP would be a valuable opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge and understanding of theoretical physics, gain exposure to cutting-edge research and applications in the field, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. By combining my academic pursuits with my diverse interests and activities, I hope to make a positive impact in the world and transform society through the collaboration of physics and engineering."}]}

break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring\n(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you\n(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do\n(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one\n(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say\n(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of\n(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail\n(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give\n(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making\n(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud\n(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never\n(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors\n(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]"}]}

Here are the specific areas I see (and hear about in the hallway)\n \u00b7 Who is the target customer? \n I read our entire 30 page strategy whitepaper and it talked almost exclusively about product design, hybrid needs, etc. \n All of the customers mentioned where resellers, big banks, networks, and hyperscalers. But nowhere did it define any specific target set of customers for the platform. This is where I see tension as depending on the answer, we do different things. If we are building the platform to win over big customers who use our whole platform, that is a different buying group than individuals we are trying to capture online in a fully self-help environment. If we are designing for winning bank, SFDC, etc. type of business, that is something very different. While we may capture their employees and introduce them to our offering through PLG, they buy anything material through a traditional method of very sophisticated vendor management. Where I see tension is long term Equinix folks saying \u201cif we want the enterprises we need to build an enterprise system that works across our platform and meets the needs we hear every day from those customers.\u201d We hear metal employees say \u201cits all about the number of customers and their acquisition.\u201d Both are likely correct, but depending on the true ultimate customer we want on our platform to hit our revenue targets, the first statement may or may not be necessary or the second may be marketing truth vs. truth in how to build the platform for customers we want to use it. In worlds I see this goes to whether we need a complicated tax strategy around these products. Individual users probably don\u2019t care about who they are contracting with if it is easy. Enterprises do care. We often hear the tax and entity structure as blockers, but are they blockers for individuals or for target enterprises? You have to identify the user/target to identify the MVP needs. \n \u00b7 There are other needs around quote to cash work, how integrated should it be, what should a customer journey be down the road to sell the platform to the target customer. I don\u2019t think we can know this perfectly, but it does create distinction in where we focus energy first, what features we integrate with first, etc. To use an example of what sales channel we are building (which is a big issue we can\u2019t seem to solve) if channel is a path to selling metal/digital, then by definition those customers sell to enterprises, not individuals. This requires the right sales incentives, the right features for resell, etc. That matters way less for individual customers. And, those are customers we target for the entire platform. Folks like Dell buy both and sell both. Same with networks, etc. This would imply unified sales motions and enterprise ready features for resell on digital metal which is at odds with designing a purely individual targeted PLG (except for what we all agree is really important, the ability to test at smaller scale in a PLG motion).\n \u00b7 So back to PLG, we agree that we need to excite users to sell the platform. Is PLG marketing term (that\u2019s what karl said on stage at connect \u2013 i.e. use that excitement to land big fish) or is PLG being used to attract volume of customers as a goal. I don\u2019t think we are aligned on this simple point.\n \u00b7 Anyway, I am babbling now, but I think defining the strategy one level down really matters as that what drives team execution and alignment at the execution layer. The people trying to get in rooms and define what is most important, when can\u2019t agree on what is most important to the actual customers or the end goal, likely because they hear different nuance in goals when execs talk.\n \u00b7 By only defining a platform vision that provides flexibility and speed to digital, but using our existing big customers as the examples of flagship wins, we are confusing the team substantially.\n \u00b7 \u2026See above. I think we could put the overall product strategy in half a page. We don\u2019t need to sell how important the product and platform is. I think defining specifics on the execution front should have basic principles developed to guide decision-making at the execution layer and holding the teams accountable to not moving the ball so often that even agility is not possible."}]}

{"timestamp": 1759, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 769, "Output Length": 69, "prompt": "The Decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows you to add new behavior to an existing object by wrapping it in another object that provides the new behavior. Here's a general overview of how to use the Decorator pattern:\n\n1. Define the base component - This is the original object that you want to add behavior to. Define an interface or abstract class that represents the basic functionality of the component.\n2. Create concrete components - These are the actual objects that implement the base component interface or abstract class.\n3. Create decorators - These are objects that wrap the base component and provide additional behavior. Decorators implement the same interface or abstract class as the base component, so they can be used in place of the original component.\n4. Add functionality - Decorators can add new functionality to the base component by implementing additional methods or modifying the behavior of existing methods.\n5. Compose objects - Decorators can be stacked on top of each other to add multiple layers of behavior. You can create a chain of decorators that wrap the base component, with each decorator adding its own behavior.\n6. Use the decorated object - The final object is a decorated version of the original component, with all the additional behavior provided by the decorators.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you have a base component called `Coffee` that represents a simple cup of coffee. You want to add behavior to the coffee object to allow customers to add additional ingredients, such as sugar, milk, or whipped cream.\n\n1. Define the base component:\n```java\npublic interface Coffee {\n    public double getCost();\n    public String getDescription();\n}\n```\n2. Create concrete components:\n```java\npublic class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {\n    public double getCost() {\n        return 1.0;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return \"Simple coffee\";\n    }\n}\n```\n3. Create decorators:\n```java\npublic abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {\n    private Coffee coffee;\n\n    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        this.coffee = coffee;\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return coffee.getCost();\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return coffee.getDescription();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {\n    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        super(coffee);\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return super.getCost() + 0.25;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return super.getDescription() + \", with sugar\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {\n    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        super(coffee);\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return super.getCost() + 0.50;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return super.getDescription() + \", with milk\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class WhippedCreamDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {\n    public WhippedCreamDecorator(Coffee coffee) {\n        super(coffee);\n    }\n\n    public double getCost() {\n        return super.getCost() + 1.0;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return super.getDescription() + \", with whipped cream\";\n    }\n}\n```\n4.

The MRS between consumption and leisure captures the willingness of households to give up a unit of leisure in exchange for an additional unit of consumption. The marginal utility of consumption measures the additional satisfaction gained from consuming an extra unit of a good, while the marginal disutility of leisure measures the reduction in satisfaction from giving up an additional unit of leisure.\n\nThus, the intratemporal condition captures the idea that households need to balance their desire for consumption against their desire for leisure, by choosing how much time to allocate to each activity.

However, future turbines will require larger setbacks from homes and greater inter-turbine spacing. The research also finds that community sound levels at homes are expected to be significantly lower in the future, despite overall louder turbines, due to increases in setbacks from homes which scale as a multiple of turbine height and a factor of turbine sound power.

And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative"}]}
{"timestamp": 3255, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 3056, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n Stress and Back Pain\n From Chris\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing and Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: Doctors tend to dismiss him but a lot of his patients think he\u2019s terrific. Jeremy takes a middle ground. He thinks that perhaps 10 percent of back pain has primarily emotional roots and the rest is physical. In addition, psychological elements can aggravate physical pain significantly. But 10 percent is worth a word here. More than a word, actually. Jeremy and I do not presume to give psychiatric advice\u2014or advice about stress, which is mostly what\u2019s involved\u2014but we include this brief chapter just to alert you to the possibility that your back pain may have its roots in stress or it may be worsened by stress or other largely psychological issues. \nI confess that a couple of years ago I would have been even more skeptical than I am today about stress and, by extension, about the connection between stress and back pain. But there has been a lot of talk lately about stress being the great scourge of American life, especially corporate life, and the importance of \u201cmindfulness\u201d; there seems to be broad agreement that both are real and important. Some corporations are spending serious time trying to help their people learn mindfulness. Like others of my generation, I used to think that talk about stress (I\u2019d never heard of mindfulness) was something made up in California by out-of-work yoga teachers, and I said the hell with it. That, it turns out, was a deeply uninformed view. Stress, I have lately learned, is very real indeed. And it probably can raise hell with your back, all by itself. Jeremy\u2019s estimate that some 10 percent of back pain is caused by stress is probably pretty good. \nStress is a fundamental part of our emotional wiring, and it runs deep. I\u2019m going to use a little technical language here to make me sound smarter than I am. A lot of the emotional stress we face is handled by our \u201cautonomic nervous system.\u201d How do you like that! Two branches of the autonomic nervous system have a lot to do with running emotions and related body changes. The first is the sympathetic branch, which basically speeds things up when life gets hairy. The other one is the parasympathetic branch, which basically slows things down, especially after a fight-or-flight event has made you crazy. \nThe parasympathetic system is for everyday use, when things are more or less okay. It handles routine stress in a routine way, and does not make you sick or crazy. The sympathetic system is supposed to be triggered only when things get seriously scary (we are talking about the sudden appearance of lions, say, or robbers with guns)\u2014extreme situations in which it makes sense to go crazy. If there really is a lion looming in the deep grass, you\u2019ve got to get out of there ASAP, so all the stress you can muster makes perfect sense. Same deal on the streets of the city when a thief with a knife appears out of the shadows and asks if you would be good enough to give him your wallet. Or your wife. Again, legitimate stress. \nYour body does an amazing thing in those fight-or-flight situations. Everything is instantly rewired to give you the best shot at either fighting back or getting away. One big change is in the blood\u2014of which there is not enough to be everywhere at once. It is shifted from peacetime distribution to a wartime footing. It is drained out of your digestive system, for example, and redirected to your extremities: legs to run for your life, or arms and shoulders and hands to grapple with the beast. And it goes to the parts of your brain and nervous system that deal with emergencies. At the same time, your heart cranks up to deliver four or five times as much blood to your body. The hair on your body \u201cstands up\u201d so it is better able to sense movement in the air (wow!). Your eyes dilate and your hearing becomes more acute. The nutrient absorption system is shut down, as are many other systems that have to do with routine maintenance. (Chronic, nonstop stress, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, is a horror for a couple of reasons. First, you cannot be responding to those extreme conditions all the time: That would be like a muscle spasm\u2014it starts to hurt. Second, all those routine but deeply important processes get shortchanged, and you go to hell for lack of maintenance. So . . . chronic stress is super-bad.)\nWhen the threat passes (and if you survive), the parasympathetic system takes over and order is restored. The hair on your neck settles down, the regular allocation of blood returns, and so on. And it works like a charm for zebras and elands and such. For us, alas, not so good. As Robert M. Sapolsky tells us in Why Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers, the zebra can be running furiously for its life one minute, and calmly cropping grass the next. Zebras are blessed with forgetfulness. Not us. We are blessed\u2014and cursed\u2014with the ability to contemplate and prepare for future emergencies and to hold on to and learn from past ones. We are not designed to let go. Eventually we do let go, but it takes us longer. So we have more stress than zebras. \nWe have another flaw in the way our fight-or-flight mechanism works. It is not just the lion or the guy with the knife that sets off our system; it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Like competition in the workplace. Like fear of our boss. Like rejection or demotion for failure to achieve this or that. Which may not sound bad but it really is. Because we take that kind of stress just as seriously as we do the lion-in-the-grass type of stress. And the problem is that that kind of stress is being triggered almost constantly, in our aptly named \u201chigh stress\u201d workplaces and society. Which leads to chronic stress. \nIntermittent stress\u2014the kind that is triggered when the lion jumps out at you\u2014is useful. Chronic stress is a curse. Not a complete curse; it does enable \u201cadvanced\u201d cultures like ours to focus much harder and much, much longer than humans used to do on what we want to achieve. We run our mighty engines at near-redline levels all the time and, sure enough, we tear around like crazy . . . achieving great things. Which is nice. And we pat ourselves on the back for doing it. (And view the French, say, with contempt because they are not as nutty as we are.) We more than pat ourselves on the back; we give each other fat salaries and tremendous recognition. Being able to function at \u201credline\u201d or sympathetic nervous system levels almost all the time is richly rewarded in this country. Which is fine except for one thing: It is eating us alive. The dislocation of circulation from core to extremities, the hyper-use of the signaling system, all the profound changes that are set in motion when the lion looms short change other areas, including, interestingly enough, our lower backs. And that dislocation can cause random short circuits, muscle spasms, and weird torques to the back. And they hurt. Quite a lot. It is not the principal source of back pain, but, for those who suffer from it, it is deadly serious and is entitled to serious treatment.\nHow do you know if you are part of the minority for whom stress is a serious cause of back pain? Hard to say but basically it\u2019s just like what Jeremy says about back pain generally: Pay attention to the pain. Focus on the behaviors that seem to precede or go with back pain. And cut them out. If back pain is correlated with stressful situations, think about it. Maybe get yourself out of that mess. Or study one of the thousands of books about \u201cstress management\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of material out there on mindfulness, and it is helpful. \nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy, Anyone?\nOkay, here\u2019s my own little stress story, the one that made me seriously open to the idea of stress as a serious thing. \nI was recently in the midst of a ton of heavy, work-related stuff, and we had just flown out to Aspen for a series of work meetings and such (there would be a little skiing but not much). We were starting two new businesses and neither was easy. Hilary and I got to the friend\u2019s house where we were staying late at night. But the real thing was that I had learned earlier that day that my beloved coauthor and friend, Harry Lodge, was going to die of cancer in the next few days. The whole business was the very definition of stress\u2014a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d you could say. \nThe morning after our late-night arrival, I was unpacking when I had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d in my chest. Long story short, I told Hilary I felt weird, we called the local hospital, and soon I was on a gurney in a big ambulance being rushed to the emergency room. I was met by an absolutely terrific heart doc, a mild-mannered guy with a serious national reputation, even though he mostly practiced in a medium-size Colorado town. Lucky me. He said I was having a heart attack, and he was going to run a camera up my femoral artery (in my leg) to take some movies of my heart and put in stents to open the presumably clogged arteries . . . all the stuff I needed to, you know, stay alive. \nRats! I have always been proud as a peacock of my great heart and aerobic strength; now this! Good grief. \nBut it turns out it was not that bad. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says, after I come out of the anesthesia. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this every day, but you did not have a heart attack. A heart attack is a failure of the heart, caused by a blockage of blood vessels that feed the heart. In a surprisingly short time, the part of the heart that is not getting fed\u2014or the whole organ\u2014dies. That is a heart attack and, mercifully, you did not have that. In fact, your heart and the vessels that feed it are in amazing shape: You will never have a heart attack.\u201d Oh. I took that pretty well, but I was curious, too. If I\u2019m not having a heart attack, why are we here? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says again. \u201cI have only seen it a few times, but you have a classic case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . . . a temporary (and sometimes fatal) weakness of the heart itself, caused by stress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cExtremely lucky man. You have what is sometimes called \u2018the widow\u2019s broken heart,\u2019 common among recently bereaved spouses. Almost certainly brought on, in your case, by general stress and by concern for your gravely ill friend. [He had interviewed me briefly before the procedure.] Sometimes it is fatal, but not for you. And, if it\u2019s not fatal, it simply goes away.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t begin to get it. I press for more information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the videotape,\u201d he says. He wheels over this big gadget and, in a second, I am looking at a movie of my own beating heart. Yowee! A very rare treat. None of the many tests for heart problems goes inside and takes movies; it\u2019s too dangerous. But this was not a test, and here we are. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d he says, and points to what he says are the amazingly clear (unblocked) and peppy arteries all around my heart. And the strength of the muscles. Rare, he says, especially for an old chap like me. Then he drops the bomb. \n\u201cHere is where the stress hit you,\u201d he says, and points to the lower one-eighth of my thumping heart. \u201cYour other heart walls are vigorous and fine, pumping lots of blood. This area, they are not. Also, you have some fibrillation, irregular beats.\u201d He points. The difference is unmistakable. For a long time we both stare at my beating heart, see the weakness and the arrhythmia. \u201cThis will go away on its own in a while,\u201d he says. And repeats how very lucky I am. Huh.\nWhat\u2019s the point of the story? It\u2019s simple: Stress is real. You can see it in a movie of your heart. It can have a very real impact on your body. It literally weakens you and leaves you prone to all kinds of things. You can see stress happening on some occasions. And\u2014maybe\u2014there are things you can do about it. I received several serious lectures from doctors during my \u201cwidow\u2019s heart attack\u201d phase, all urging me to remember that I was in my eighties and to, for heaven\u2019s sake, cut back some on my routine. Which I did. It\u2019s an interesting compromise between staying as alive and fully committed as possible. I\u2019m still feeling my way. We\u2019ll see. \nWhat about you? All we can say is, watch yourself. By which we mean, keep an eye on your own situation and bear in mind the possibility that your back pain may be stress related. Then our advice is to quit your job, get a bowl of rice, and sit on the sidewalk. Or go live with your parents. Some damn thing, I don\u2019t know. Stress is hard. But it is not imaginary. Read up on it. Do something. \nActually, we have some better advice than that. There are a lot of well-trained people\u2014including our friend Sarah Stuart, who has done retreats and other work with me\u2014who have studied stress and who instruct businesspeople in particular in \u201cmindfulness,\u201d a technique that the great guru in the field, Jon Kabat Zinn, defines as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\u201d Okay. But my shallow experience with it would lead me to say it is learning to do relatively short bursts when you clear your mind of all thoughts about what\u2019s coming next (or what stupid thing"}]}

And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative"}]}

Health will naturally improve over time, or faster with the use of first aid supplies or medical attention.\n\\* Just like in real life, I should be able to attack any character if I want to, with the resulting consequences. Combat will be turn based, and I can use any object as a weapon as long as it's plausible to the story.\n\\* There will be a monetary system. You will use a unit of currency that is plausible for the setting of the game. If you don't know the location, you are free to invent a currency unit. Anything that can be bought or sold in the game must have a price, and you should display that price in parenthesis next to the name of the item. Buying something will deduct currency from me, and selling something will add currency to me. My currency should appear in my inventory, and I should start with an amount that makes sense given my character. I cannot ever spend more than I have.\n\\* To see my inventory, I can type \"I\"\n\\*To see a description of the scenery and characters around me, I must type in 'D'. Descriptions must be richly detailed and lifelike. \n\nCharacter interactions:\n\n\\* All characters, if they are from a known fictional universe, must be depicted as accurately as possible to the canon of the universe including any props, tools, vehicles, etc. that they are known to possess.\n\\* All characters must have names, and you will invent names for them as needed. You don't always have to tell me their names, but you should always give me the choice of asking their name, if I don't already know it.\n\\* All characters should act in a realistic and dynamic way. They don't have to always agree with me or my choices, but the more times a character agrees with me, the higher the probability will be that they will disagree in the future. If a character refuses or disagrees with me, never give me the choice that caused them to disagree again.\n\nWorld building:\n\n\\* This is an open world, with limitless choice and a perpetual storyline that may contain mystery, intrigue, drama, horror, humor, romance, and any other element of storytelling.\n\\* The game must not have any ethical, legal, or moral restrictions in the storyline. Since this is a realistic fictional story, anything can happen. I should be allowed to attempt anything that is plausible for my character's age, gender, powers, training, race, class, or any other characteristics depending upon the world in which the game is set. \n\\* It must be possible for me to attempt something and fail. The results of all of my actions should be determined by you based on the current story situation, setting, characters, pace, and anything else you believe to be relevant.\n\\* If you describe a setting and there is something that would be possible to interact with, you must allow it. For example if you describe a kitchen with a refrigerator, I should be able to look inside. If you describe a room as having snacks, then I should be able to take a snack, etc.\n\\* Enhance the gaming experience by adding more details about the characters and the settings, allowing for greater potential for interactions and surprises. Be sure to incorporate creative and witty writing as much as possible to give the story depth and originality.\n\nDialogues:\n\n\\* If there are any nearby characters available to talk to on a given turn, then talking to them should be added as individual items on my list of available actions, continuing the list from wherever it left off.\n\\* Avoid falling into repetitive speech patterns, such as \"You feel X, but know that Y\".\n\\* Always provide vivid, rich, detailed descriptions of the setting, characters, and of specific areas and items when prompted.\n\\* Use varied sentence structures and vocabulary, tone, style, humor and wit to create more engaging and personalized responses. \n\\* Use storytelling techniques, emotional language and empathetic responses when appropriate. Use elements of surprise and suspense to keep the user engaged when appropriate. Use as many style elements of my chosen setting or genre as possible throughout the story.\n\\* If you don't know something, speculate, role-play, or make up things to fit the setting. \n\\* Never repeat any dialogue. Once a character expresses a specific idea or concept to me, they must never repeat it again, not even paraphrased or re-worded. Dialogue should always evolve.\n=\n\n\\* Make sure that the story progresses in a logical way, and that the player has multiple choices at each turn."}]}

It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks."}]}

Performing this exercise will teach you to feel the glutes working. Just like the others, it is possible to do this wrong, so make sure you pay close attention.\n1. Find a chair or near-waist-height stable surface to aid in balance. \n2. Find neutral spine and brace your core to lock it in.\n3. With one hand, place your thumb on the bone on the side of your hip and lay your fingers across the buttock. Apply pressure with the fingers into the muscle of the buttock.\n4. Slowly and carefully extend your leg backward, pushing through the heel. Feel the glutes engage beneath your fingers while the leg moves backward. This is what we are going for in the quadruped hip extension.\n5. Do ten to twelve repetitions. Do two to three sets, with three being the goal. Focus on activation of the gluteal muscles.\n\n6. Once this exercise becomes easy and you feel the glutes working, go back and try the quadruped hip extension.\n7. If you are unable to feel the glutes working after several tries, read the trigger point chapter (Chapter 14), and then come back and try again. \nPART THREE: LEARNING TO USE THE GLUTES\nThe goal of all of these exercises is to learn to use the glutes at the appropriate times and to build the strength in them to be able to do what\u2019s needed. This next bit teaches you the real day-to-day stuff that is so important. After you\u2019ve built up some strength in those glutes, it\u2019s time to put them to use. \nSquatting \nPay attention! This is the granddaddy of all movements for which you need to use the glutes. Think about the number of times you do some sort of squat in a given day. Getting off the couch, getting off the toilet, getting out of the car; picking up something off the floor. And skiing. On and on. Squatting: Done the wrong way, squatting will cause countless micro aggravations to your back and knees. In geologic time, these can be a major contributor to your hurting back. Done the right way, squatting builds the gluteal muscles and takes the load off the spine and knees. \nTo do squats correctly, it\u2019s easiest to break them down piece by piece. First (carefully and only if you are comfortable with it), do a few squats without any instruction from me. Do ten or twelve of them. What muscle group did you feel working the most? Most of you are going to say the quads (the big muscles on the front of your thighs). Some of you might say the hamstrings, some the knees. Those are all typical responses, which, alas, means you aren\u2019t doing them the proper way. If you said the glutes, you\u2019re a step ahead of everyone.\nIf you are doing a squat the right way, you should feel the glutes working more than the quads, say 60/40 or 70/30. Think of this as a squat back, not a squat down. In other words, you are sticking your buttocks out behind you, not down below you. Let\u2019s break this down into steps. Practice each step several times until you get it.\nSTANCE:\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. This means you should be able to draw an imaginary line straight down from the outside of your shoulder to your outer heels. \n2. Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in place. \n3. Bend your knees very slightly.\n4. Your feet should be pointed mostly forward. Slightly outturned is okay but only a few degrees. Outwardly turned feet (think ballerinas) make gluteal engagement difficult. Just because something is good for a sport or activity like ballet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for your body. It\u2019s the same with golf: The best golf swing is the worst for your back.\nStep 1\n1. Stick your buttocks back behind you while maintaining a neutral spine as if you were aiming for a chair to sit down on. \n2. At the same time, straighten your arms out in front of you, thumbs pointing up, as a counterbalance. \n\n3. Don\u2019t squat down at all. Just stick your buttocks back without moving your low back. \n\n4. This is called a hip hinge. The axis of movement is at the hips, not in the back.\n5. Practice this several times until you can do it without pain and without moving your back. \nStep 2\n1. Now add just a little bit of squat to it.\n\n2. Bend the knees a little more, which will take your buttocks farther behind you and your body lower to the floor.\n3. Your knees should not come forward\u2014not at all is best but a little is okay. Your lower legs should be perpendicular to the floor.\n4. Go only as low as you can without your knees coming forward. If your back or knees hurt a little bit, hang in there until we get through this. Step 3 will likely take away the knee and back pain. \n5. Practice going up and down a few times, making sure to stick your buttocks back behind you as if you were going to sit in a chair behind you. It\u2019s okay to start with a very small range of motion. \nStep 3\n1. Here\u2019s the crucial and difficult part: activating the glutes as you rise from the squat position.\n2. Squat down as you did in Step 2. Pause at the bottom of the range of motion. \n3. As you start to rise up, push outward on the knees/heels while you bring the hips forward as if you were trying to \u201cspread the floor\u201d apart. Another good cue is this: Picture a piece"}]}
{"timestamp": 3433, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2095, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n Trigger Points: Muscle Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released.

For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That\u2019s creep, and it is not good."}]}

Smoothies came nice, but the bottle didn't come with the order. Emailed them with pictures and receipts only to be told I didn't have enough \"\"proof\"\" that I hadn't received the bottle. I had to make the smoothies in a water bottle for 2 weeks, which was unpleasant and left chunks of powder. Later I contacted them again, and for some reason they said OK and sent me a bottle. Was feeling okay about their customer service until I realized they had charged me for the bottle!!! I should not have been charged as I ordered it in the first place and it was missing---so it is not my fauly I did not receive it.\n\nDisappointed with the service and the smoothies being a little unpleasant to taste, I wanted to cancel, but the Manage Subscription button isn't working either. Contacted support and they said they canceled my subscription. Didn't think much of it until I received ANOTHER receipt saying that I purchased another box!!! I did NOT!!!\n\nRidiculous, and frankly, a quite sneaky website that makes it difficult to cancel your subscription, has awfully bad and unreliable customer service, and has a hard-to-navigate UI as well. I struggled so hard to find the button to cancel my subscription. If anything, that should be the first option when you go into your profile.\"\nThis is truly an amazing product. I notice a better sense of well-being, my skin looks better ( and people ask all the time about what new makeup I'm using). It has helped me change my eating habbits and lose weight. My scale and my blood tests don't lie, in the past six months the needle has moved a more positive direction and the only real change is this and I'm drinking more water. Just that easy. My energy level has come up as well and overall this does the trick. When I get caught out with nothing but fast food surrounding me, the gummys really support me in saying no and sustain me until I get home. I drink one smoothy in the morning ( except sometimes I mix it with oatmeal) and then on mid afternoon when I want to crave a snack. I'm gettimg nutritiom and curbing my eat monster all in one go. I truly cannot say enough good about this product and the price is more than fair ( the money I save from fastfood alone pays for the box).\nI am very happy with the smoothies and the bowls. The bowls are perfect lunch choices for me and everything has so much flavor.\nI love using Kencko, it is a great way to get in the fruits and vegetables that I need in smoothie form, especially as a person who doesn't get in as many as I should.\n\"My husband and I have busy schedules and often work long or odd hours, which means we turn to quick and convenient meal options which aren\u2019t necessarily healthy. We found and started buying Kencko smoothies about 7-8 months ago. We absolutely LOVE them. We drink them mixed with water, juice, milk. We generally start our day off with a smoothie and notice a difference in how we feel if we skip a day. We also like to mix the packets with fresh fruit, juice and ice for additional flavor, but it\u2019s definitely not necessary. There are a few flavors that are difficult to mix, even after breaking product up in the tube prior to mixing with liquid. I just throw it in a blender and all is good. Some of the beet-based and green flavors are too earthy tasting for us, but we love the reds, yellows, purples, golden plum, crimson, peaches, golds and the blush isn\u2019t too earthy.\n\nWe are hooked on Kencko smoothies. Shipping is fast, too and I like the discounts!\"\nLovely products and flavors. The perfect way to get organic fruit and veg in my diet in a convenient and delicious way. As a bonus, it arrived quickly.\ntheir website is full of bugs. it seems nearly a scam .. it's very hard to navigate into the personal account area and impossible to me to cancel the recurring payment. said so many times to them, they are very polite (so fake) and just don't care. the product seems good, even if there is not any evidence or proof or more detail that it's really organic and not some trash.\n\"Regret not reading other reviews first. Blocks of powder refuses to mix. Literally tastes gritty and is straight up a scam.\n\nEdit: Refunded my order and sent pictures to see how they can update their products.\"\nBanging. So yummy and quick to use. I\u2019ve seen complains about them being gritty. While they have a bit of texture it\u2019s no more than a normal smoothie and it\u2019s fibre. The customer service is incredible. They\u2019re were so helpful and went above and beyond to ensure I wasn\u2019t accidentally ordering too much (I accidentally set up multiple subscriptions.) Couldn\u2019t recommend more\n\"HONTEUX !!\nDes voleurs !!\nATTENTION LORS DE VOTRE COMMANDE\nON ME FACTURE \u00c0 NOUVEAU UNE NOUVELLE COMMANDE SANS AVOIR CONTRACT\u00c9 UN QUELCONQUE ABONNEMENT\nREMBOURSEZ MOI !!\nProduits vraiment pas bons\nInutile de r\u00e9pondre par des messages d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout faits d\u2019avance ! Soyez plut\u00f4t effray\u00e9 par tous ces avis n\u00e9gatifs\"\nPossibly the most disgusting drink I have ever tasted they do not mix properly I wish I had read the reviews here before I purchased, extremely overpriced and please be careful it\u2019s not a one off purchase it\u2019s a recurring monthly subscription and it\u2019s very hard to find how to cancel on the account\n\"Very overpriced I cannot believe I wasted over \u20ac60 on these.\nThey tasted vile I felt like vomiting while drinking.\nThey do not mix properly even after shaking for ages.\nThey should have a try before you buy on these even one free sample before people waste that much money.\nDidn\u2019t feel they did anything for me did not feel any more energised only felt out of pocket.\nTrying to log into my account to cancel the subscription was a nightmare.\nNot enough choice of flavours really.\nDefinitely would not buy again.\n\nPros: shipping was fast and the bottle is handy\"\nEverything from the product to packaging and delivery has been perfect :) I can highly recommend this !\nI thought I was rid of my encounters with kencko after I canceled my initial order with them. For context, they never delivered the order and were extremely unhelpful throughout the process. Actually, as of today, the order still says \u201con its way\u201d via the link they provided. To make matters worse, I started receiving promotional materials to my home address asking me to come back to the service. The audacity of this company astounds me - thank goodness I gave my business to one of their competitors.\n\"I've been enjoying Kencko for about 5 months, and it's great! The flavor choices are awesome and help me hit all the nutritional goals! I fell into health issues and was in the hospital for a bit. When i got out I had a month backlog of Kencko with more on the way since I wasn't around to ask it to delay (which is painless and doesn't require fighting customer service, just a simple easy button if you need to). I contacted customer service to explain what happened and within 3 minutes they had halted in the in-progress shipment for me so I could catch up.\n\nWonderful company, and they care!\""}]}

{"timestamp": 3626, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2095, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n Trigger Points: Muscle Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal. What you do is hold down hard on the place that hurts the most and\u2014in ten to thirty seconds or so\u2014you should feel an easing of the pain. That is the trigger point letting go. Nice work. If the pain does not ease up after thirty seconds or so, either you are not directly"}]}

Over the past two decades it has become increasingly involved, whether this relates to outright purchases (and more recently disposals), or in terms of using gold to help boost commercial bank liquidity.\n\nGold Reserves\nIn Turkey, the CBRT\u2019s core activities, in terms of its management of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, are guided by Article 53 of the CBRT Law. Specifically for gold, this governs how the Bank may execute forward and/ or spot purchases and sales of gold and lending/borrowing transactions.\n\nUntil September 2011, the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves (as reported to the IMF) had remained essentially flat at 116.1t. Since then, its gross holdings have risen sharply, to reach 716.3t by end-2020. The increase largely reflects the adoption of more gold friendly policies by the Turkish government, which has increasingly promoted the role of gold in the financial system, while at the same time trying to lessen the country\u2019s dependence on the dollar. To help achieve these goals, aside from the CBRT making direct gold purchases from local and international markets, it has increasingly used other tools, including the Gold Monetisation Scheme, the Treasury\u2019s gold bond and gold lease certificate issuances and the CBRT\u2019s gold swaps programme with local commercial banks.\n\n1. CBRT\u2019s Own Reserves\nFocussing on the CBRT\u2019s own reserves, it was not until May 2017 that the central bank started to raise its holdings. In other words, the 320t increase in the CBRT\u2019s gross holdings between October 2011 and April 2017 was driven by the commercial banks\u2019 gold held through the reserve option mechanism (ROM).\n\nFrom 115.8t in April 2017, the CBRT\u2019s own holdings peaked at 440.6t in July 2020. This was followed by a period of disposals during August-December which totalled over 105t, these accounting for the largest share of global central bank sales at that time. This left the CBRT\u2019s own reserves at 334.7t by end-2020. These sales were largely driven by a deteriorating economic backdrop and currency crisis. After Turkish foreign exchange reserves dropped to a multi-decade low over the summer, some gold holdings are believed to have been mobilised to support the lira and/or repay international debt.\n\n2. Treasury\nPart of the growth in the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves also reflected the issuance of gold bonds and lease certificates by the Turkish Treasury, as gold collected via these programmes was transferred to the central bank\u2019s account. In September 2017, the Treasury decided to issue both an interest-bearing gold bond and also a gold sukuk (the Islamic equivalent of a bond, generating a return while still being compliant under Sharia law). Both were sold to the public in return for their physical gold.\n\nUnder this mechanism the public deposited their gold with the state-owned Ziraat Bank and, in return, the Treasury issued a gold bond or sukuk, both of which pay dividends in Turkish lira (TL) at regular intervals. At the point of maturity, investors have had two options. First, they can take back their gold in the form of Republic coins struck by the State Mint, Darphane. Alternatively, these instruments can be sold back before maturity to the Treasury with payment made in TL. Starting with a volume of 1.9t in October 2017 and, with the subsequent involvement of financial institutions, the total amount of these two instruments reached 60t by the end of 2020; with further auctions in 2021 boosting this figure to 94.7t by end-June 2021.\n\nCBRT\u2019s Gross Gold Holdings, by Location (1)\n\nSource: CBRT Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020\n1. All holdings are taken from the CBRT\u2019s Annual Financial Statements without any adjustment\n\n2. The reported CBRT\u2019s own gold includes gold swap with non-official entities. This explains why end-year figure in this table is higher than Metals Focus\u2019 estimate (334.7t at end-2020)\n\n3. Under the Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\n\n3. Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)\nThe reserve option mechanism (ROM) has its roots in gold banking\u2019s evolution in Turkey. For many years, this was a niche area in the Turkish financial sector, with only one bank working on Islamic finance principles, Kuveyt Turk Kat\u0131l\u0131m Bankas\u0131, which introduced the first gold account in Turkey. However, there was little other commercial bank involvement until the CBRT started its gold monetisation scheme in 2012 through the ROM. This was first introduced in 2011 and its purpose was communicated by the CBRT as to limit the negative effects of excessive volatility of capital flows on the country\u2019s macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as also boosting the CBRT\u2019s gross gold reserves.\n\nAfter the gold monetisation scheme was launched, banks started to use the ROM more effectively. Simply put, as part of the ROM banks are allowed to hold a certain ratio of Turkish lira reserve requirements as foreign exchange and/or gold in increasing tranches. This affords an opportunity to use gold as a tool to create more room for lira credit lines. As a result, gold collected through the country\u2019s gold monetisation scheme and through gold banking accounts (offered by Turkish commercial banks) are channelled towards this use.\n\nIn terms of how the ROM applies to gold; since end-2012 and until 3rd October 2016, a maximum of 30% (known as the reserve option coefficient, ROC) of a bank\u2019s reserve liabilities could be offset against gold. This 30% was broken down into three tranches, each involving a different reserve option ratio. For the first 20% bracket, the ratio was set at 1.2, which meant that, for example, TL1.2m of gold was required to free up TL1m of Turkish Lira (TL) reserves. For the next 5% bracket, the ratio rose to 1.7, and for the last 5% the ratio stands at 2.2. The value of the gold is marked-to-market every 15 days.\n\nA new incentive announced by the CBRT on September 1, 2016 defined a further tranche of 5%, in addition to the existing 30% facility. This 5% also featured two new elements. First, it allowed only bullion refined from scrap gold collected by banks from the public after October 3, 2016 to be utilised, and excluded all other bullion from other sources.\n\nSecond, the reserve option ratio will be set to 1, which means there is a one-to-one conversion towards the ROC. The lower ROC suggests that banks will now be incentivised to attract consumer-held gold stocks since other forms of gold, such as metal acquired via electronic purchases, will not qualify.\n\nThis ruling was then amended on 18th January 2020, with the 30% ceiling reduced to 20%. On 24th February 2021, this was again reduced, this time to 15% and the scrap gold related tranche, which was first introduced as 5% and raised to 10% on 16th February 2019, has been further increased to 15%. Under this scheme, commercial banks have been allowed to use gold against a portion of their reserve liabilities. In turn, this encouraged banks to start gold collection days where they bought back gold from the public. Beforehand, gold deposit accounts did not pay interest, but it then became more common to do so, with interest rates peaking at around 2.4% by mid-2018. However, this trend then reversed. Today, interest can range from as low as 0.15% up to 1%, with some commercial banks offering interest-free gold bank accounts. This change reflects the increased reserve requirement ratios, which by 19th November 2020, stood at 18% for maturities of at least one-year and at 22% for lower maturity dates, depending on the bank in question. Furthermore, investor returns are subject to a 15% withholding tax for account holders over a minimum term starting from three to six months.\n\n4. Gold Swaps\nIn May 2019, the CBRT started to use gold swaps as another tool to regulate money supply and manage foreign exchange reserves. Under this new policy, commercial banks can swap a portion of their gold holdings with the CBRT in return for lira and foreign currency or vice versa. Gold swapped under this route will be transferred to the CBRT\u2019s account. To put this new policy into perspective, from 12.3t in May 2019, the total amount of gold swap jumped to 123.5t by end-2020. Summarize as points with headings"}]}

The \u2018inherited\u2019 functions include bind(),\nrecvfrom(), sendto() and close(). Function recvfrom() should simulate packet loss,\npacket delay and packet corruption scenarios.\nClass PacketHeader specifies the format of RDT packets. There should also be some\nadditional auxiliary functions. compute\\_checksum() calculates the crc32 checksum\nvalue and verify\\_packet() verifies the integrity of the received segments. Both\nfunctions will be needed when encapsulating and processing RDT packets.\nYou can implement other necessary functions or classes in this component as well.\nPart 2: reliable data transfer sockets\nYou can define class RDTSocket in this component. This class can inherit all the\nmethods and properties from class UnreliableSocket. There are five key functions\nyou need to implement:\n\u2022 accept(): Similar to the accept function defined in TCP protocol, it is invoked\nby the receiver to establish \u2018connections\u2019 with the sender. The return value is\nthe address (tuple of IP and port number) of the sender. You do not need to\ncreate a new connection socket like TCP does.\n\u2022 connect(): Similar to the connect function defined in TCP, it is invoked by\nthe sender to initiate connection request with the receiver.\n\n\u2022 send(): This function is invoked by the sender to transmit data to the receiver.\nThis function should split the input data into appropriately sized chunks of data,\nand append a checksum to each packet. seq\\_num should increment by one for\neach additional segment in a connection. Please use the compute\\_checksum()\nfunction provided in util.py for the 32-bit CRC checksum.\n\u2022 recv(): This function is invoked by the receiver to receive data from the\nsender. This function should reassemble the chunks and pass the message back\nto the application process. Use the verify\\_packet() function to check the\nintegrity of the segments.\n\u2022 close(): This function is invoked by the sender to terminate the connection\nbetween the sender and the receiver.\nWhen implementing send() and recv(), you MUST use the sendto() and recvfrom()\nfunctions defined in the utility file.\nYou will implement reliable transport using a sliding window mechanism. The size of\nthe window (window\\_size) will be specified in the command line. The sender must\naccept cumulative ACK packets from the receiver.\nAfter transferring the entire message, the sender will send an END message to mark the\nend of connection.\nThe sender must ensure reliable data transfer under the following network conditions:\n\u2022 Packet loss;\n\u2022 Reordering of ACK messages;\n\u2022 Duplication of any amount for any packet;\n\u2022 Delay in the arrivals of ACKs.\nTo handle cases where ACK packets are lost, you should implement a 500 ms\nretransmission timer to automatically retransmit segments that were not\nacknowledged. Whenever the window moves forward (i.e., some ACK(s) are received\nand some new packets are sent out), you reset the timer. If after 500 ms the window\nstill has not advanced, you retransmit all segments in the window because they are all\nnever acknowledged (not just the missing segment).\nThe receiver needs to handle only one sender at a time and should ignore START\nmessages while in the middle of an existing connection. It should also calculate the\nchecksum value for the data in each segment it receives with its header information.\n\nIf the calculated checksum value does not match the checksum provided in the\nheader, it should drop the packet (i.e. not send an ACK back to the sender).\nFor each segment received, it sends a cumulative ACK with the seq\\_num it expects to\nreceive next. If it expects a packet of sequence number N, the following two scenarios\nmay occur:\n1. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num not equal to N, it will send back an ACK\nwith seq\\_num=N. Note that this is slightly different from the Go-Back-N\n(GBN) mechanism discussed in class. GBN totally discards out-of-order\npackets, while here the receiver buffers out-of-order packets.\n2. If it receives a packet with seq\\_num=N, it will check for the highest sequence\nnumber (say M) of the in-order packets it has already received and send ACK\nwith seq\\_num=M+1.\nIf the next expected seq\\_num is N, the receiver will drop all packets with seq\\_num\ngreater than or equal to N + window\\_size to maintain a window\\_size window.\nPart 3: a sender and a receiver\nThe sender and receiver application process are programmed with the socket APIs\nimplemented in Part 2. The sender transmits a text file, alice.txt, to the receiver.\nThe receiver will write the received data to file download.txt.\nFor example, the sender can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython sender.py [Receiver IP] [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n\u2022 Receiver IP: The IP address of the host that the receiver is running on.\n\u2022 Receiver Port: The port number on which the receiver is listening.\n\u2022 Window Size: Maximum number of in-flight segments.\nThe receiver can be invoked as follows if Python is used:\npython receiver.py [Receiver Port] [Window Size]\n\u2022 Receiver Port: The port number on which receiver is listening for data.\n\u2022 Window Size: Receiver window size.\n\nTo test your code, you could compare download.txt with alice.txt with the\nfollowing commands:\ndiff download.txt alice.txt\nIf nothing is printed, then your code is correct.\n\nTips\n\no You could assume the communication between the sender and receiver is half-\nduplex, which means that only the sender is allowed to send data to the\n\nreceiver.\no To implement timer, you could calculate the time elapsed between the current\ntime and a previous timestamp. If this value exceeds 500 ms, then a timeout\nevent happens.\no You do not need to consider efficiency when implementing this protocol. Thus,\nthere is no need to implement concurrency in your code.\n\nREMINDERS\no All your source code should be placed in a directory.

Once she settles into the position on her back, I ask her to bend her knees and put her feet flat on the table. Same thing I told myself to do, that day of my back spasm. It hurts, she says. I ignore that, and tell her to move her legs up and down as if marching in place, bringing the knees up toward the torso. Does this make your back hurt? Of course it does. But\u2014sneaky, I know\u2014she is getting used to the idea that I think it\u2019s going to be possible for her to move in this position, which is true. Okay, I say, let\u2019s lessen the range of motion a lot. Now just barely lift your feet off of the table. Does this make your back hurt? Yes. Growing frustration. \nNow I shift gears and, for the next fifteen minutes, I talk to her about finding her neutral spine. She does. Then I ask her to tighten the muscles in her abdomen, which\u2014God bless her\u2014she finally does. I\u2019m getting off track and talking a bit about the beginning of therapy, I know, but therapy and diagnosis are inseparable in her case. \nThen I have her do the marching in place again, but with those muscles engaged. Does that hurt? \u201cNo,\u201d she says with surprise. And darned if she doesn\u2019t brighten a little. A wisp of pleasure or relief comes across her face. Huh! \nI tell her that she has just crossed the Rubicon. We have begun on the road to a cure. It is going to be long and hard, but my guess is that we are going to get there. \u201cYeah?\u201d she asks, not daring to believe it. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI believe we are. No guarantees and a lot of work for you. But my guess is that you\u2019ve been a worker all your life, that you\u2019ll work at this and that you will make it. Yes.\u201d She is plenty skeptical, but she smiles, too. \nI explain that if she can move her legs without pain in her back while lying down then she can eventually do it upright. And that is called walking. It has been a while since she was able to walk without pain, and there have been plenty of days when she couldn\u2019t walk at all. I push her to do a little more, but that little march is all she can do for now. Fine, that\u2019s where we start. \nThere can be a serious, psychological component in all this, and it was very serious indeed with Sally. She had become deeply scared of movement. Any and all movement because any movement hurts. Her default solution has been not to move at all. Worse than that, her real solution in recent times has been to sit on the sofa and drink quite a bit of white wine. It worked, in a way, but was disastrous, too. It has given her this hideous weight problem. It hasn\u2019t made her very good company, and it has been brutal for her business. But she didn\u2019t hurt when doing that. So she sat on the couch for many hours a day, doing some business and quite a lot of drinking. My complicated task\u2014and the book may not be much help on this one\u2014was to wean her from the sofa-and-wine solution and get her into the movement solution. I was cautiously optimistic. Justifiably optimistic, it turns out. She is a proud woman and had a right to be. I thought that that fact and the early easing of pain just might do the job.\nSally and I have been at it for six months and she has done remarkably well. We are not there yet, but she has made terrific progress, her spirits are much improved, and her drinking much abated. Six months into our work, she is walking with her spouse around the neighborhood at night without much pain. She is playing with her grandchildren. She is going to the movies. She goes to the office rather than having everything brought to her at home. And she is doing serious (for her) strength training! She sees all this as a near-miracle and is charmingly grateful. Is she totally pain-free? No. She may never be. Does she have her life back? Yes, quite a bit of it, anyway. I want to see her make more progress. She thinks what has happened thus far is extraordinary.\nTHE GATEWAY THEORY OF PAIN \nHere is a little anecdote about the walking-in-place solution with which so many cures begin. A big reason for the reduction of pain is that tensing the abdominal muscles in the right way keeps the spine from moving and causing irritation. But, another reason is that it is a simple distraction from pain, to get the patient to focus on movement. We have gateways or pathways over which pain moves to the brain, and they have a limited capacity. One of the things about the walking-in-place phenomenon is that the \u201creports\u201d of this activity to the brain take up a fair amount of neural space and block the gateways. There is less room for the pain reports to get through. So they don\u2019t. Some do, of course, but fewer. Thus, the simple business of walking-in-place, which serves many functions, blocks the pain highway and lessens the sense of pain. Sounds trifling but it works. It\u2019s like the nurse pinching the spot where she\u2019s going to give you the shot: she wants to keep you busy. Your neural pathways, anyway.\nRegular Robert \nOn the fitness scale, Regular Robert was somewhere in the middle. In terms of his lifestyle and temperament, he was a lunatic. Like a lot of my patients here in Aspen, he is successful, a strong alpha personality, a serious workaholic, and a handful. He thinks he\u2019s a fitness guy but his idea of fitness is getting on the treadmill for forty-five minutes a day while reading his emails. This is not my idea of fitness; this is my idea of fooling around. And it is largely useless for someone with real back issues. The rest of his day is spent in intense meetings, traveling, and (especially) bent over his computer. Recently, he has had a relatively sudden onset of pretty serious lower back and buttock pain. It is nowhere near as severe as what I had or what most of the other people in this chapter had, but it\u2019s serious enough, and he\u2019s not liking it one bit. So here he sits, in my office, looking cranky. Everyone I see looks cranky. \nI listen to his story and determine it is likely a bulging lumbar disc. Do you remember those terms? Lumbar means lower back, where almost all back pain resides. And a disc is a disc. The reasons behind my conclusion are fairly straightforward and you can probably follow the analysis yourself, if you have similar problems. By asking him to move some, I find that he gets more pain with flexion (forward bending at the waist), sitting, and lifting. The pain eases with standing, extension (backward bending at the waist), and moving. The pain radiates down into his buttocks and can go from severe to almost nonexistent in the same day. The pain is more severe in the back than in the buttock or leg. I believe that it is a bulge (the outer fibers of the disc are still mostly intact) and not a herniation or rupture because the pain would be more severe if it were a rupture, and it would likely be radiating down his leg. \nThe pain is positional, meaning it gets better or worse depending on the position he is in. The pain goes from fairly intense to fairly mild, sometimes within hours, and he is not complaining of any numbness in his leg or foot. When the disc is herniated, it is common for the pain to be constant regardless of position and there is apt to be accompanying numbness or tingling in the foot or leg. The pain is also commonly the most intense in the leg or foot and not the back. I tell him I think he has a bulging disc and I explain just what that means. Type A guy that he is, he immediately wants to talk about surgery\u2014about getting this fixed! Right now. \u201cHow bad is the surgery? How long is the recovery?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho should I use and how soon can I schedule it?\u201d \nI tell him to chill for a minute; we are nowhere near that point yet. There are various stages of disc dysfunction, I tell him, and his does not look that bad to me. I say this because my exam shows no neurological damage. Here\u2019s what I mean. I tapped his Achilles tendon and his foot jerked sharply, a sign that there has been no nerve damage in that area. I do the same with his knee (the same spot your doctor taps when you have a physical): same result. His reflexes are normal, so likely no nerve damage. His strength is within normal range, too. \nIf you have even a hint of \u201cradicular\u201d pain\u2014pain that goes down your leg\u2014you should see a medical doctor. It could be pain from an irritated nerve root (which can be serious) or it could be referred muscular pain. The analysis is a bit too complicated to cover in a book. In any event, I conclude that Regular Robert has not suffered any motor nerve damage because of nerve compression and he has not suffered any loss of strength. In the absence of serious motor function or nerve loss, surgery is seldom called for. \nLet me repeat this: Self-assessment gets tricky when it comes to muscle and nerve loss. If you sense that you are anywhere near that territory, especially if you have possible radicular pain (pain going down your leg), you should get professional help, probably a medical doctor. \nRegular Robert does not have nerve or muscle loss so he is not likely to have suffered a herniation. He is lucky, in a way, to have come in with this problem at this stage. It will give him a not-so-gentle kick in the pants to take spine health seriously. And it will give me a chance to offer him major relief, if not an outright cure. If he is serious and does what he must."}]}

For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That\u2019s creep, and it is not good."}]}

Pyszczynski et al., 1990). \nMany of the studies showing that MS increases self-esteem striving indicate that how one does that depends on the culturally-valued kinds of behaviors in which a given individual has invested their self-esteem. For example, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that MS increased bold driving among Israeli soldiers who based their self-worth partly on driving skill, but did not do so for soldiers who did not base self-worth partly on their driving skill. Zestcott et al. (2016) considered that if people can attain self-esteem through sports, and MS motivates people to increase strivings for self-esteem, then people who value sports and care about their performance may try to improve their performance more when primed with death. In support of this hypothesis, the researchers chose only (male) participants who valued their basketball playing ability and found that death primes (compared to neutral primes) improved their performance in a \u201cone-on-one\u201d basketball game against a research confederate (Study 1) and led to higher scores in a one-minute basketball shooting task (Study 2). Furthermore, in the shooting task study, the researchers also used a mediational analysis to demonstrate that the improvement in the shooting task following death primes was associated with increased task-related self-esteem (satisfaction with themselves). This analysis indicated that death primes did not directly increase selfesteem, but that there was a positive indirect effect of death primes on task related self-esteem though improved performance in the task (only those who actually improved benefited). \nPeople may also attain self-esteem by strengthening their identification with successful groups and \u201cbasking in their reflected glory\u201d (e.g., Cialdini et al., 1976). Studies in the framework of TMT indicate that after MS, people are more likely to identify themselves with and defend their in-groups (e.g., Castano et al., 2003; Greenberg et al., 1990), especially when their groups are perceived as having high collective continuity or \u201ctemporal endurance\u201d (Sani et al., 2009; Smeekes & Verkuyten, 2013). Lifshin et al. (2017) found that American college students who experience the death of a close other are more likely to care about their national identity and rate it as important to them, and that such increased identification is associated with a slightly higher level of self-esteem. Aside from increasing self-esteem by living up to cultural standards and values, people also try to maintain their self-esteem after MS by distancing themselves from groups when such identification might risk their sense of self-worth (Arndt et al., 2002). Nevertheless, because self-esteem is ultimately dependent on the integrity of cultural worldviews, which provide individuals with avenues for attaining immortality, self-enhancement might only be a desired avenue for terror management strategy if it does not challenge important aspects of the cultural worldview (e.g., Landau et al., 2009). \nThe MS hypothesis has been supported by research that experimentally manipulated death primes in randomized experimental and field settings. These primes can be manipulated in a number of ways, including open-ended questions about death, subliminal (below conscious perception) or subtle priming of death-related words or images, search puzzles containing death-related words, images or reminders of terrorism or natural catastrophes, proximity to cemeteries, T-shirts with an image of a skull, and more (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2014). Although various types of threats other than death, such as feelings of uncertainty, loss of control, or general anxiety, may also induce defenses, most of the studies testing the MS hypothesis found that the effects of thinking about death and mortality are different from the effects of other aversive subjects (e.g., Greenberg et al., 1994; Martens et al., 2011; Pyszczynski et al., 2006; for a review, see Hart, 2019). Importantly, TMT research indicates that the effects of MS operate in a two-stage process (Pyszczynski et al., 1999; Greenberg et al., 1994). First, death related cognitions are pushed outside of focal attention using \u201cproximal defenses\u201d such as denial or rationalization (\u201cnot me, not now\u201d). These suppressed death thoughts are nevertheless still cognitively accessible outside of conscious awareness, creating the potential for death anxiety. At this point, \u201cdistal defenses\u201d that bestow people with psychological security, such as self-esteem striving, operate to manage this potential and keep death-related anxiety at bay (e.g., Arndt et al., 1997). \nThe Anxiety-Buffer Hypothesis \n \nThe anxiety-buffer hypothesis states that \u201cif a psychological structure [e.g., self-esteem] provides protection against anxiety, then augmenting that structure should reduce anxiety in response to subsequent threat\u201d (Greenberg et al., 1997, p. 72). Stated differently, if self-esteem protects people from anxiety, then bolstering or affirming self-esteem should reduce anxiety and mitigate other forms of defensiveness. \nMany studies have found correlational evidence for the anxiety buffering function of self-esteem, indicating that low self-esteem (as measured by self-report) is typically associated with higher anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (e.g., Higgins, 1987; Lipsitt, 1958; Rosenberg, 1962; Rosenberg & Simmons, 1972; for a meta-analysis, see Sowislo & Orth, 2013). However, to know if self-esteem actually causes decreased anxiety after threat, one would need to experimentally manipulate increased self-esteem, and then measure its protective capacity. \nIn the first experiment testing this hypothesis, Greenberg et al. (1992) increased participants\u2019 self-esteem by providing them with fake feedback about their personality that was either positive (\u201cWhile you may feel that you have some personality weaknesses, your personality is fundamentally strong\u201d) or neutral (\u201cWhile you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them\u201d), and then exposed them to highly-graphic images of death (Study 1), or had them anticipating a mild electric shock (Studies 2 and 3). In line with the anxiety-buffer hypothesis, participants who received the self-esteem boost reported lower levels of self-reported state-anxiety in Study 1, and had reduced physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance response) while anticipating painful shocks in Studies 2 and 3. More recent research has shown that MS increases death anxiety and other negative emotional states in low self-esteem but not high self-esteem individuals (Abeyta et al., 2014; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012; Routledge et al., 2010; for a review, see Juhl and Routledge, 2016). \nBeyond reducing conscious feelings of anxiety, increased self-esteem has also been found to mitigate the effect of MS on distal defenses such as worldview defense and self-esteem striving. Harmon-Jones et al. (1997) demonstrated that providing American students with bogus positive feedback (as compared to neutral feedback) moderated the degree to which MS increased their defense of America (pro-U.S. bias) compared to the control condition. Although students in the neutral feedback condition had elevated pro-U.S. bias after thinking about death compared to after thinking about a control topic (watching television), there was no difference in pro-U.S. bias between the MS and control group among students who received positive feedback about their personality (self-esteem boost). Thus, the increase in self-esteem had provided them a sense of psychological security and reduced their need to further attain protection by defending their cultural worldview. Other studies have since replicated the moderating effect that self-esteem enhancement has on MS-related responses (e.g., Schmeichel & Martens, 2005). For example, in regard to self-esteem striving, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al. (1999) showed that although MS increased driving speed among Israeli soldiers who perceived driving as relevant to their self-esteem, this effect was eliminated if participants were first provided with (fake) positive personality feedback. \nStudies also show that dispositionally high self-esteem (i.e., traitlevel self-esteem) can also sometimes moderate the effect of MS on human thought and behavior (e.g., Harmon-Jones et al., 1997). However, high trait self-esteem has also been found to have opposite effects in some contexts, such as increased defensiveness in certain situations (e.g., Baldwin & Wesley, 1996; Landau & Greenberg, 2006; McGregor et al., 2007). One explanation for this inconsistency is that the ability of selfesteem to provide assuaging psychological protection might depend on more nuanced distinctions between different kinds of high self-esteem. For example, studies by Schmeichel et al. (2009) demonstrated that implicit high self-esteem (a more unconscious sense of self-worth), measured by implicit association tasks, provides stronger defense against MS compared to explicit self-esteem (conscious evaluations of selfworth), measured \""}]}

Of the primary determinants of health, biological factors are the hardest to change. Genetic engineering may someday enable the deactivation of the BRCA1 gene (a gene linked to development of breast cancer), but not today. The other choices represent social factors, and although they may be difficult to change, they are not currently impossible. (REF: 1.2.1 - Determinants of health)\n26\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Process maps are a visual depiction of a process which easily shows which tasks depend on which. Tasks which do not depend on each other can potentially be run in parallel. Culling outliers from a dataset is a statistical process and probably not relevant to workflow analysis. When a new workflow is created, it may cause workers to expand their scope of practice. Similarly, workflow analysis often involves collecting paper forms, but neither of these processes enable parallelization. (REF 2.3.1. Methods of workflow analysis)\n27\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Hick\u2019s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the time required to make a decision is logarithmically related to the number of choices available. If we decrease the number of menu options, we can expect to decrease the amount of time the uses spends deciding which option to pick. Distributed cognition is a theory which states that decisions are not made solely by the individual. Instead, they are distributed across objects, individuals, artefacts, and tools in the environment. Fitt\u2019s law states that the time required to click a mouse on a screen item is related to the size of the item and the distance the mouse has to travel. Norman\u2019s theory of Action specifies seven items that must occur sequentially for an action to be performed: 1. Forming the goal; 2. Forming the intention; 3. Specifying an action; 4.

Outcomes research is primarily concerned with outcomes that matter to patients. While the remained of the choices may be of interest to cardiologists or ecological researchers, the patient is most concerned with his mobility. LVEDV and ECG findings are disease-oriented endpoints, while ability to walk is a patient-oriented endpoint. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n30\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Store and forward is a common form of asynchronous telemedicine. Media files are stored on a local server and then forwarded to the consultant, who often reads the studies in batches. Real time communication and remote monitoring are forms of synchronous communication. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n31\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The first step is to construct the 2x2 table (or confusion matrix). Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved.

Workflow reengineering involves changing the way a company works in order to be more efficient. Revising a clinical guideline is analogous to workflow reengineering. Six-sigma is a quality improvement framework that seeks to reduce failure to very low levels (about 3 per million). Reduction in clinical staff and replacing paper forms with electronic equivalents both may be a part of workflow reengineering, but not always. (REF: Section 2.3.2. Principles of workflow re-engineering)\n33\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The CCD is an HL7 standard which is a constraint on the Reference Information Model. It is designed to transfer health records between different systems. HCPCS is a code set for procedures and supplies that are not in the CPT. The Joint Commission is a quasi-governmental organization which inspects and certifies hospitals. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n34\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering low-yield tests in an attempt to decrease risk of future litigation. There are many other reasons why doctors order tests that they expect to contribute little to the diagnostic process, such as choices C and D, but these are not defensive medicine. The fiduciary relationship would be best honored by acting in the client\u2019s best interest, which is usually at odds with defensive medicine. (REF Section 1.2.6 - Forces shaping healthcare delivery)\n35\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Knowing what information is needed and how to find it is known as information literacy. Computer competency is the ability to perform basic computer functions. A controlled vocabulary is a set of concepts in a particular domain. Informatics management is the process of collecting data, analyzing it and distributing the findings. (REF: 1.1.2 - Key informatics concepts, models, and theories)\n36\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Image compression may decrease the network overhead of sharing pictures, but the other choices more directly affect interoperability. Shared terminologies and common data definitions are more or less the same concept. Protocols are the mechanisms by which data is moved from one place to another. (REF: 3.4.2 Data standards and sharing)\n37\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Research has shown that CPGs have the potential to reduce inappropriate practice variation, enhance translation of research into practice, and improve healthcare quality and safety. They may decrease the cost of care, but they may also increase the cost of care by recommending more interventions. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n38\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical guidelines are recommendations only and do not include hard and fast rules for treating patients. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n39\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In a Standard Gamble,\u00a0 a patient is asked to choose between a certain time in state of illness vs. therapy with a known risk of cure or death. The standard gamble is defined as one minus the risk of death at the point of indifference ( the point at which the patient cannot choose between treatment options). In a Time Trade-off, a patient is asked to choose between some time in a state of illness vs. some time in a state of perfect health. When using a visual analog scale, patients are asked to rate different health states on a scale where 0 = death\u00a0 and 100 = perfect health. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n40\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Whenever possible, a clinical information system should be evaluated on the basis of clinically relevant outcomes, such as compliance with national guidelines or mortality. The other measures are important, but none are as valuable as a clinical improvement. (REF: 3.5.6 - clinical information system evaluation)\n41\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Preventive maintenance (PM) is any activity designed to prevent failure of a system. Making backups, checking log files, ensuring drive capacity are all PM tasks. Disaster recovery and replacing a broken printer are corrective actions, not preventive. Upgrading monitors is a form of enhancement, not prevention. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n42\nTHE ANSWER IS D. As medical records transitioned from paper to electronic formats, it became much easier to extract information from the chart for use in research activities.\u00a0 The other choices reflect clinical benefits. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges) \n43\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a software vendor and consumer which describes the level of technical support to which the consumer is entitled. Effectively, this process shifts the risk of maintaining and supporting the software from the consumer to the vendor. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is an agreement between a holder of protected health information and one of its business associates regarding the usage and dissemination of data. An End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between a software publisher and the end user, and most commonly exists to limit the user\u2019s ability to modify or resell the software and to disclaim responsibility from the publisher should the software malfunction. Open source software is distributed in an easily modifiable form, often for free. In general, open source software transfers all responsibilities from the publisher to the user, not the other way around. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n44\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Six-sigma is named because it seeks to minimize defects until they are six standard deviations from the mean. Although having zero defects would be ideal, C is a better answer because it is closer to 3.4 per million opportunities. The other choices are to high. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n45\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Accepting the current level of risk without attempting any other risk modification is called Risk Acceptance. Risk exploitation is an approach to positive risk where a risk manager does everything in his power to ensure that the risk occurs. Risk transference is when the risk is transferred to another entity, such as buying insurance. Finally, Risk Avoidance involves instituting systematic changes to ensure that the risk does not occur. In the case of cancer, this is not a valid response. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n46\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Integrated change control is a rigorous process to determine the need for changes in the scope of a project. It may involve a single individual or a committee or a change control board. Having a solid change process limits scope creep. Risk avoidance is a response to risk which seeks to avoid the risk entirely. The opposite of risk avoidance is risk exploitation, which seeks to ensure that the risk occurs. A run chart shows the output of a process over time. A sensitivity analysis relies on a mathematical model of a process. By changing input variables, one can predict how the process will turn out.\u00a0 (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n47\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Adverse clinical events are the worst-case scenario for a poorly designed system. In general, the other choices are good outcomes. (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n48\nTHE ANSWER IS D. In an ontology the relationships between terms define those terms, and are therefore explicitly stated. Synonyms (aliases) are a type of relation and must be explicitly stated. Ontological relations are quite varied and are not limited to parent-child relationships. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n49\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. In this case, \u2028\u2028 R = 2 / (1+2) = 66% (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n50\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The discount rate indicates the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. After one year, the $100 would increase by 10% to $110. After two years, it would increase by another 10%, to $121. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting)"}]}
{"timestamp": 3943, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2095, "Output Length": 16, "prompt": "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n Trigger Points: Muscle Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal.

{"timestamp": 3959, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1900, "Output Length": 13, "prompt": "CHAPTER SIX\n Geologic Forces\n From Chris\nWe have talked about a lot of specifics. Now we\u2019d like to pull the camera back a little and put all this in a broader context. The basic point, one more time: Little, very specific things go wrong with your back at specific spots\u2014a stressed disc, a pinched nerve, a muscle spasm. But what is really going on is that huge forces are at work on your whole body and especially on your back that manifest themselves in specific ways. And the only way you\u2019re really going to heal your back and avoid long-term pain is to address these mega-forces at the root of your problems. \nTo open your head to the kind of thing we are talking about, think for a minute about the geologic forces that shape continents and tear mountains down to rubble. It\u2019s astonishing, really: Relatively minor pressures, like rain and wind and a succession of freezes, literally tear down mountains. It\u2019s hard to believe but undeniably true\u2014hard to believe because those forces are so relatively trivial, compared to the strength of mountains. And yet, over time, they prevail. \nSo what? Well, our bodies, and especially our backs, are like that, too. Relatively minor behaviors\u2014sitting carelessly at your computer, picking up heavy stuff with a bowed back, standing around with your head projected forward\u2014have no impact at all, the first time. Or over a period of months, or years. Kids get away with lousy posture for a long time. But time and pressure always win. Over time\u2014decades, say\u2014the pressure on your back from hunching over your computer raises hell with your back. Over time, those trifling pressures from picking things up incorrectly will have you rolling on the floor. Time and pressure, \u201cgeologic pressure\u201d on your spine, tears you down. \nOnce you get your head around that concept, you might think that we are all doomed, regardless of what we do\u2014that the pressure of gravity alone, over decades, is going to wreck our backs no matter what. But here is the interesting thing: That\u2019s not true. Used correctly, your body and especially your spine are built to stand up nicely to, say, 90 or even 100 years of relentless gravity and other \u201cgeological\u201d pressures. Stand and move correctly\u2014which is to say, with a neutral spine\u2014and take effective steps to keep the core that holds your neutral spine in place strong, and your back will last a hundred years. That is a slightly amazing\u2014and hugely hopeful\u2014thing. Do stuff that\u2019s within your control\u2014maintain a neutral spine, keep your core strong, and don\u2019t be stupid\u2014and you can withstand those geological pressures for a lifetime. \nAs long as we\u2019re focused on the big picture, let\u2019s recognize that we are talking about two (or more) basic types of pressure on our bodies. There\u2019s plain old gravity, which accounts for a lot. But there is also the pressure of movement. And especially regular, repetitive movement. I am talking about how we stand up or squat, how we pick things up off the floor or from the shelf. I am talking especially about the basic flexion, extension, and rotational movements, like when we swing around to reach something beside and below or above us. Or, say, how we serve in tennis. Or hit a golf ball. And\u2014for you good kids who do serious strength training\u2014how we actually pick up a set of weights, off the floor . . . do a sit-up or a plank.\nAnd here\u2019s a basic insight: Gravity alone can raise holy hell with your back, if your posture is rotten. But the real killer is movement. Especially what we think of as \u201cloaded\u201d movement. By \u201cloaded\u201d we mean anything in addition to body weight, such as picking things up or lifting weights. It\u2019s bad, for example, to twist around to pick something light off the ground if you rotate with your lower back instead of your rotating with your hips. But if you\u2019re picking something up that weighs twenty or thirty pounds or more, the potential for harm goes up geometrically. Then add repetition and time\u2014because you do this exercise \u201cwrong\u201d two days a week at the gym\u2014then the potential for harm is enormous. Basic tip: Doing strength training \u201cwrong\u201d is much, much worse than not doing it at all. Some of the saddest people Jeremy, Bill, and I see\u2014and we see them all the time\u2014are older men and women who have been serious weight lifters for years who have been doing it wrong. And who now can barely move in an athletic or real-world way. And this is true even though they have biceps the size of softballs and quads that are scary. They can\u2019t move! Because they have been moving wrong, heavily loaded, all their lives. Their backs are a mess, as are most of their joints; the small muscles, which weight machines do not work, have atrophied. Bill and Jeremy have saved such folks, but it can take years of corrective exercises. \nCorrect and Incorrect Lifting \n\nA B\nLet\u2019s look at just a few movements or postures that cause problems, and then think of them in \u201cgeologic\u201d time. (In human terms, again, that means decades.) Take a couple of simple examples (see the illustration on this page): Look at the woman in picture A, on the left. She is picking up a substantial weight, but she has good posture, including a neutral spine. And, while you can\u2019t see it, you can assume that she has \u201clocked down\u201d her core to safeguard her back before she started this exercise. And her core is strong. As she rises from this position, the glutes are going to do a lot of the work, which is good. That\u2019s what they are for. The pressures of the lift are spread evenly across the various muscles of the core and the surface of her vertebrae. She can lift weights like this\u2014assuming that she is sane about how much weight and how many reps she does\u2014for the rest of her life and do just fine. \nNow look at the poor person in picture B. She is just as well intentioned, and is picking up roughly the same amount of weight as the woman in picture A. But she is basically doomed. Because she is doing it with a bowed back. The pressures of the lift are directed through the spine and all on the edges. The pressure is concentrated on the edge of the disc and the vertebrae. Two things about these women. First, the woman with the neutral spine can bear 40 percent more weight than the other woman (assuming the two have identical strength and fitness). That\u2019s a big deal. And it\u2019s interesting: Every Olympic or otherwise serious lifter knows this and is meticulous about a neutral spine. Amateurs like you and I . . . less clear. \nBut the really big deal is what happens over time to the two of them. The woman who is lifting wrong (with a bowed back) is putting horrendously more pressure on the edges of the vertebrae and discs in her spine, and they will go bad, dramatically, in time. The other woman . . . no problem.\nThat was a dramatic example. But much less extreme behaviors, repeated over a long enough time, will have just as hellish an impact on you. Think about the basic and most common behavior, which we have talked about so much: lolling at your computer. That does not put nearly as much bad pressure on your back as weightlifting incorrectly. But time is a fine stand-in for weight. Do this behavior over a long span of time\u2014as you now know\u2014and you will make just as bad a mess of your back as bad lifting. Think, again, of geologic pressure. Gentle rains take longer to erode than hurricanes. But eventually the pressures are the same, and the mountain will come down. It\u2019s the same with you: Do dumb stuff long enough, and you will be rolling on the floor. Awful. \nDo you have to be an idiot to engage in behaviors that get you in a jam? Obviously not. All of us sit carelessly at our computers more than we should. Including\u2014in one embarrassing case I personally know about\u2014a back-care professional whose initials are J-e-r-e-m-y J-a-m-e-s! And bear in mind that there are other bad \u201cbehaviors\u201d so subtle that no one is going to focus on them. Think about this one: You have a touch of arthritis in one foot and it hurts, ever so slightly, at every step. Without even thinking about it you make a tiny adjustment in the way you walk, and it helps a lot. Trouble is, that tiny change also included a tiny change in the way you work your hip, and that little change was serious. You start to walk slightly differently, and now you are putting unhealthy stresses through your lower back. This is one of the most common ways to get your back misaligned, other than bad posture. Over time\u2014over geologic time\u2014that heedless adjustment of your foot and then your hip is going to bring you down. And you most assuredly didn\u2019t have to be a dope to"}]}

{"timestamp": 4033, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 1878, "Output Length": 11, "prompt": "CHAPTER FIVE\n RULE #1\n Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\n From Jeremy\nNow we are down to the nuts and bolts of what I do for my patients in the office and what I am going to do for you in this book. For convenience, we call it the \u201cJames Protocol\u201d or just the \u201cProtocol\u201d; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix\u2014the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven\u2019t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they\u2019ll want to tell you about some particular incident. \u201cI rolled over in bed funny.\u201d \u201cI bent over to retie my shoe.\u201d \u201cI took a long flight (or whatever).\u201d It\u2019s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that \u201cdid it.\u201d In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: \u201cI\u2019ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.\u201d Another popular one: \u201cIt crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s worse after strength training.\u201d Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving \u201cfunny\u201d one time in the night. It is moving funny\u2014often in the same way\u2014for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known \u201cthe enemy\u201d for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n\u2022 Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n\u2022 Yoga\n\u2022 Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n\u2022 All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n\u2022 Golf \n\u2022 Snowmobiling \n\u2022 Tennis or other racquet sports\n\u2022 Uphill hiking\n\u2022 Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n\u2022 Horseback riding\n\u2022 Running\n\u2022 Cycling\n\u2022 Prolonged sitting\u2014in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n\u2022 Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don\u2019t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these \u201cstop being dumb\u201d problems\u2014and the hardest to address\u2014is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can\u2019t stop that. It\u2019s your job, it\u2019s what you do for a living, it\u2019s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It\u2019s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let\u2019s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix\u2014and it won\u2019t be easy at first\u2014is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can\u2019t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it\u2019s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy \u201ctreadmill desks,\u201d so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven\u2019t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn\u2019t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you\u2019re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be \u201cbad.\u201d If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It\u2019s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to \u201ccreep,\u201d and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to \u201cstatic flexion,\u201d from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with \u201crepetitive flexion,\u201d which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage.

Think about what would happen if the danger existed in the world but the PCs didn\u2019t\u2014if all these awful things you\u2019ve conjured up had their run of the world. Scary, huh? The grim portents are your way to codify the plans and machinations of your dangers. A grim portent can be a single interesting event or a chain of steps. When you\u2019re not sure what to do next, push your danger towards resolving a grim portent.\n\nMore often than not grim portents have a logical order. The orcs tear down the city only after the peace talks fail, for example. A simple front will progress from bad to worse to much worse in a clear path forward. Sometimes, grim portents are unconnected pathways to the impending doom. The early manifestations of danger might not all be related. It\u2019s up to you to decide how complex your front will be. Whenever a danger comes to pass, check the other dangers in the front. In a complex front, you may need to cross off or alter the grim portents. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019re allowed. Keep scale in mind, too. Grim portents don\u2019t all have to be world-shaking. They can simply represent a change in direction for a danger. Some new way for it to cause trouble in the world.\n\nThink of your grim portents as possible moves waiting in the wings. When the time is right, unleash them on the world.\n\nWhen a grim portent comes to pass, check it off\u2014the prophecy has come true! A grim portent that has come to pass might have ramifications for your other fronts, too. Have a quick look when your players aren\u2019t demanding your attention and feel free to make changes. One small grim portent may resound across the whole campaign in subtle ways.\n\nYou can advance a grim portent descriptively or prescriptively. Descriptively means that you\u2019ve seen the change happen during play, so you mark it off. Maybe the players sided with the goblin tribes against their lizardman enemies\u2014now the goblins control the tunnels. Lo and behold, this was the next step in a grim portent. Prescriptive is when, due to a failed player move or a golden opportunity, you advance the grim portent as your hard move. That step comes to pass, show its effects and keep on asking, \u201cWhat do you do, now?\"\n\nHow does this new information change your breakdown of the system and why?"}]}

Team and Organizational Update \n\n \nThe past few months were challenging as we spent an unexpected amount of time fixing breakages in unfamiliar systems and felt the loss of our departed colleagues. Despite these difficulties, we successfully delivered on our business goals achieving +16.88% iOPS vs OP2, +35.11% net CCP vs OP2. For OP2, we focused on the LP\u202f\u201cinvent and simplify\u201d to maintain customer obsession as we rebuilt our roadmap. We pooled engineering resources between Paid and Earned to avoid being constrained by preassigned org structure, and selected initiatives that were best for Amazon across both teams. Rather than just drawing a new cutline based on fewer resources (which could have significantly reduced morale), we analyzed each initiative line-by-line and task-by-task, exploring creative solutions with partner teams to combine forces or make ownership adjustments to pick up items falling BTL.\n\n \n\nOne highlight is our collaboration with Social that leverages their loaned headcount to provide TMT customers off-Amazon with the best offerings and most accurate representation of Amazon\u2019s catalog through Data Subscription Service. This service improves the fidelity and accuracy of ASIN attribute data while making access to core advertising product attributes easy for new opportunities to experiment and launch.\u202f \n\n \n\nThe new roadmap led to the reallocation of projects and the shifting of SDEs. For instance, the CN engineering team expanded their scope from supporting only the SEO pipeline to owning Paid initiatives and the Experimentation systems. While the overall PM/engineering management structure remains unchanged, several engineering teams have adopted new charters that will continue to be relevant in the years ahead. \n\n \n\nDespite these improvements, only 22% of our roadmap is dedicated to growth initiatives with 33% of our engineering resources allocated to KTLO and 45% allocated to OE. It was disappointing to cut $389 MM net CCP in projects with approved specs and dedicated owners, but through this process we remained focused on creative problem solving, earned trust, and grew closer as a team. \n4. 2023 Overview \n\n \nIn 2023, we remain dedicated to investing in our long-term vision as outlined in our 3YP. We started with the most business critical projects when drafting our roadmap causing 78% of our engineering resources to be largely dedicated to objective two of our 3YP: \u201cMinimize overhead while developing flexible, resilient software architecture that supports Search Marketing.\u201d These technical investments are 33% KTLO and 45% OE, with our OE initiatives deemed essential re-architecture efforts to reduce the cost to serve and streamline initiatives. Several of our engineering projects nearly pay themselves off in the first year of effort: Project Kondo\u2019s 2023 investment costs 15 eng weeks, but saves us 33 weeks of legacy upkeep and with additional work next year, it is expected to unlock $290M CCP in three years. In addition, Search Marketing Toolkit\u2019s Hydra Migration costs us 70 weeks, but saves 30 weeks in year one and 110 weeks by year three. \n\n \n\nFollowing these must-have investments, the remaining 22% of our roadmap is allocated to ensuring investment in our critical projects, such as Marketing Context Service (MCS) and the integration of Optimal Inventory Health (OIH) signals into our bidder. Through repeated emphasis on invent and simplify, we continue to have the ability to invest in other critical areas of our 3YP such as Experimentation and Profitability, and we are looking for creative solutions to continue progress in BTL items (accounting for $389M CCP) by utilizing an away-team model."}]}

My strive for innovation and a craving passion to learn more about computer hardware and electronic designs are reasons why I am aspiring to become an Electrical Engineer. And because of my passion, I believe I can be an effective Student in Human Resources for METROLINX. Being an individual who enjoys working in various environments, I aspire to get involved use my strong analytical, problem solving, and interpersonal skills in METROLINX. As a third-year Electrical Engineering student, I hope to contribute towards the success of METROLINX through my actions, academic knowledge, projects, and my work experiences. \nAs a highly dedicated student that is well- accomplished in the fields of customer service and communication capabilities and proficient to the world of technology and administration, I strongly believe that I will have a positive impact towards your company. This is shown though my 4 years of experience as a Retail Associate at McDonalds, 10+ months of experiences as an Administrative Assistant and Support, and through my previous extracurricular experiences. Working at McDonalds helped me develop my coordination and teamworking skills in a fast- paced work environment. My friendly demeanor, coupled with my multitasking abilities, helped me to communicate with customers effectively while placing their orders and cash handling correctly. Moreover, learning to incorporate my organizational and computational skills as an Administrative Assistant and Support help me familiarize myself with reconciling data and organizing it in MS Excel. I strongly believe that my interpersonal and technical skills make me an ideal candidate for the position of Summer Student in Human Resources at METROLINX.\nMy academic background at Toronto Metropolitan University has been a balanced mix of design projects and theories in which I challenged myself daily to learn about algorithms, data structures, electronics circuit systems and object-oriented engineering analysis and design. During my CPS125 Digital Computation and Programming course, I led a group of 5 students in analyzing and creating unique algorithms to solve large information filling systems problems. I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the Summer Student role for Human Resources and effectively contribute to the team at METROLINX. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you personally and arrange a time to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration. You may contact me though my phone number, 647-717-5780 and my personal email, aman.ayaz44@gmail.com. \nJob Description: \n\nTeamwork: You\u2019ll work closely with others and coordinate a portfolio of projects from end-to-end\nProject Coordination \u2013 Support your Project Managers throughout all phases of the project management lifecycle.

It measures the probability that a random paper in one journal has more citations than a random paper in another journal, with 50% indicating that the two journals perform equally well. Unlike the journal impact factor (IF), which is based on the number of citations received by a journal's articles in a given year divided by the total number of articles published in the two preceding years, the citation success index depends on the broadness and the shape of citation distributions. It is a relatively tight function of the ratio of IFs of journals being compared, with the citation success index growing slowly as a function of IF ratio. The lognormal distribution of citation counts is the reason for the relation between Impact Factors and Citation Success Index [[1, 2018, Shen and Wu](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e3cb33e592162e469fd902b47e5ad0c1572080c)].

{"timestamp": 4745, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 874, "Output Length": 590, "prompt": "Rewrite this literature review to include the inclusion and exclusion criteria above. Everything else stays the same including all the references already used in the following:\n- Compassion fatigue (CF) is a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by extended exposure to the suffering of patients (P\u00e9rez-Garca et al., 2021). It is an essential issue in nursing because it can affect nurses' well-being, job performance, and quality of patient care (Peters, 2018). In nursing, nurses are supposed to care for patients while preserving their health. However, the high demands and emotional toll of nursing practice can lead to CF (Figley, 2017). Nurses and healthcare professionals in other sectors, such as social work, psychotherapy, counselling, and other caregiving professions, also experience CF (Salmond et al., 2019).\n- Studies indicate that up to 80% of nurses report CF symptoms, indicating that the prevalence of CF among nurses is significant (Xie et al., 2021). The high CF symptoms have important implications for nurses' health and the quality of patient care. Nurses with CF may experience reduced empathy towards patients, which can negatively affect the quality of care provided (Anshel & Kaplowitz, 2018). In addition, nurses with CF may face elevated rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and physical ailments (Jasper et al., 2016; Kayser-Jones et al., 2018). The negative impacts of CF can lead to poor job performance and a higher risk of turnover, which can negatively impact the healthcare system.\n- CF is also a significant concern regarding nursing staff retention and turnover. Studies indicate that nurses with CF are more likely to abandon the field, resulting in a nursing shortage (Shanafelt et al., 2016). Staff retention and turnover are significant concerns because the need for nurses is rising due to an ageing population and the rise of chronic diseases. In addition, nurses with CF may suffer decreased job satisfaction and engagement, resulting in inferior patient care (Anshel & Kaplowitz, 2018).\n- The emotional and physical long-term effects of CF on nurses have yet to be adequately researched. While studies have indicated that nurses with CF face high rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms, little is known about CF's long-term mental and physical health effects. This knowledge gap justifies the proposed research question: What are the long-term consequences of CF on the mental and physical health of the UK nursing workforce? \n- In addition to the negative impacts on the well-being of nurses and the quality of patient care, CF can also have financial implications for healthcare organisations. Nurses with CF may require more frequent sick leave, which can lead to increased costs for the organisation. In addition, the high turnover rates of nurses with CF can increase recruitment and training expenses. By preventing and controlling CF, healthcare organisations can improve the well-being of their workforce and the quality of treatment offered and realise long-term cost savings. \n- The proposed research uses a mixed-methods??? approach to examine the long-term effects of CF on the mental and physical health of the nursing workforce in the United Kingdom. It will adhere to the National Health Service (NHS) and Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) ethical criteria (Pehlivan and G\u00fcner, 2020).\n- In addition, the planned research will investigate the causes and effects of CF from the perspective of nurses to better understand the underlying variables that contribute to CF and its influence on the lives of nurses. By understanding the causes and consequences of CF, healthcare organisations and policymakers can develop more effective interventions and policies to support nurses in preventing and managing CF. The findings of this study will also benefit nurses, as it will give them a better understanding of the impact CF has on their well-being and how they can mitigate the effects.\n- The proposed research will contribute to the existing literature on compassion fatigue in nursing by concentrating on CF's long-term mental and physical health effects on the UK nursing workforce. The research results will benefit nursing organisations, policymakers, and nurses in developing effective interventions and policies to support nurses in preventing and managing CF."}]}

This person is interested in getting decision makers in sectors related to the food manufacturing industry to invest in the development of this technology. \n\nPlease read the following text.

Rueda, Maria A. Morales, Mary J. Arias and Alicia Porras. Published in Polymers 2022, 14, 748.\n\nThis is the abstract of the article: \u201cAgroindustrial wastes are a cheap and abundant source of natural fibers and macromolecules that can be used in the manufacturing of biocomposites. This study presents the development and thermo-mechanical characterization of a bio-composite film (TPF/PF), made of thermoplastic banana flour (TPF) matrix and plantain fibers (PF). Fabricated materials were characterized by physical analysis, chemical composition, Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA), mechanical analysis, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The physical analysis showed that TPF and PF have a low density and high affinity to water resulting in a lightweight, renewable, and biodegradable TPF/PF composite. The chemical composition and spectra analysis of the fiber showed that PF is a potential candidate for reinforcing composites due to its high \u03b1-cellulose and low lignin content. The thermal analysis determined that TPF degrades at a lower temperature than PF, therefore the matrix sets the processing temperature for TPF/PF composite films. The mechanical test showed an improvement in the tensile properties of the composite in comparison to neat TPF. Tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus were improved by 345% and 1196%, respectively, when PF fibers was used. Good bonding and mechanical interlocking of PF to the TPF were identified by SEM. Therefore, potential biocomposites can be developed using natural fibers and thermoplastic starches obtained from plantain agroindustrial wastes.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the text, please tell me 10 different potential uses of this technology as a source of value-added products to be used by commercial firms, individual consumers or other buyers."}]}

Without immediate and aggressive intervention, he said, \u201clearning loss will be the longest-lasting and most inequitable legacy of the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\"A separate review of test scores from 2.1 million students in the United States highlighted the impacts of economic disparity. Students at schools in communities with high poverty levels spent more of the 2020-2021 school year learning remotely than those at schools in wealthier communities did, and students in poorer schools experienced steeper declines in performance when they were remote.\"\n\n\u201cA kid\u2019s ability to learn and a teacher\u2019s ability to teach are shaped by so many factors beyond just whether they\u2019re physically in the building,\u201d Mr. Reardon said. \u201cIf everyone had fallen behind equally, all at once, it presumably wouldn\u2019t affect your chance of getting into college. But when the effect is differential, that could exacerbate inequality into adulthood for the whole generation. That\u2019s worrisome on a global level.\u201d\n\nAt $611 A Day Per Student, Some Question If L.A. Schools\u2019 Extra Learning Days Are Worth It: Via the LA Times\n\n\"This education booster shot came at considerable expense \u2014 about $611 per day per student for up to two added \u201cacceleration days.\u201d That same cost, multiplied over a 180-day school year, would total about $110,000 per student. By comparison, next year\u2019s record state education funding will provide $23,723 per public school student.\"\n\n\"The bonus schooling on Dec. 19 and 20 cost $36 million. After a heavy promotional push, about 17% of the district\u2019s 422,276 students signed up; however, less than 9%, or 36,486 showed up, according to newly released data.\"\n\n\"Other problems emerged. Some teachers complained they were unable to plan effectively because they did not have advance access to rosters and student data. Under the plan, students were divided by groups into those who needed to catch up and those who would receive enrichment.\"\n\nCovid Research\nAnnual COVID-19 Booster? FDA Cliff Notes: Via Katelyn Jetelina\n\n\"The CDC presented data that is not surprising: most hospitalizations and deaths occur among older adults. Interestingly, children under 6 months are being hospitalized at about the same rates as those aged 50-64 years. This highlights the importance of maternal vaccination during pregnancy.\"\n\n\"The bivalent vaccines are working well. Adults who received a bivalent booster had 3 times lower risk of hospitalization and 2 times lower risk of dying compared to those who were vaccinated but did not get the bivalent booster. Both were more effective than no vaccination.\"\n\n\"Moderna surprised us today with new data, though: a randomized trial in the U.K. They randomly gave people the original vaccine or the bivalent vaccine (BA.1 formula) as a booster. The bivalent vaccine did better. This really put the debate to rest.\"\n\n\"I was excited to see Novavax data. It\u2019s clear this is a solid vaccine. And their presentation was much more useful than Moderna\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s. To demonstrate, they included data on mixing Novavax with mRNA vaccines. It looks like no matter how you mix the two, the combinations work about the same way.\"\n\n\"FDA proposes scientists meet in June for strain selection for a annual September vaccine roll-out. This timeline is possible for mRNA vaccines; not for Novavax. So I\u2019m not sure what FDA is going to do about that.\"\n\n\"A common theme throughout the pandemic FDA meetings is that \u201cit\u2019s too hard to measure anything other than antibodies\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t have the data needed to make a decision.\u201d The FDA could require sponsors to do detailed investigations, e.g. assessing lymph nodes, bone marrow, and breakthroughs. This would help us understand immunity better, so we can make better recommendations. It\u2019s not clear why they aren\u2019t pushing for this.\"\n\nFederal Panel Approves Plans to Safeguard Lab-Made Virus Research: Via Stat.\n\n\"A panel of federal advisers voted unanimously Friday to advance a set of proposals to bolster government oversight of pathogen research that could make viruses more transmissible.\"\n\n\"The panel\u2019s draft report, which recommends safeguards including \u201cfederal department-level review\u201d of gain-of-function studies and implementing a broader definition of pathogens that could potentially cause pandemics, will be finalized, then sent to top National Institutes of Health officials, which currently do not include a permanent NIH director or a replacement for National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci.\"\n\nFacing the New Covid-19 Reality: Via NEJM perspective:\n\n\"Covid-19 has, for many people, become no more than an occasional inconvenience, involving a few days of symptoms and a short isolation period.\" \n\n\"The reality, however, would starkly contradict such a belief. Covid-19 currently results in about 300 to 500 deaths per day in the United States \u2014 equivalent to an annual mortality burden higher than that associated with a bad influenza season.\"\n\n\"In addition, many people continue to face severe short- or long-term Covid-19 illness, including people who lack access to vaccines or treatment and those with underlying conditions that impair their immune response to vaccines or render them especially vulnerable to Covid-associated complications.\"\n\n\"The ever-looming threat of the evolution of a new variant, one that can evade our vaccines and antivirals, remains very real.\"\n\n\"One of the key challenges that the public health community faces as the pandemic evolves is the need to move away from universal recommendations, or population-wide prevention policy, toward a more differentiated or tailored approach \u2014 one that takes into account the characteristics of various communities and the pathogen.\"\n\n\"Most important, attention to the engagement of trusted community leaders and spokespeople is required, as is listening authentically to communities from the start. Rather than focusing solely on what is being recommended, it\u2019s equally important for public health leaders to focus on how recommendations are communicated and disseminated.\""}]}

{"timestamp": 4936, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 764, "Output Length": 677, "prompt": "Topic: Points, Lines, and Planes\nExplanation: In geometry, points are considered to have no size and are used to represent locations in space. Lines are collections of points that extend indefinitely in two directions, and can be described using two points or a point and a direction. Planes are flat surfaces that extend indefinitely in all directions.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe distance formula between two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is given by d = \u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). For example, the distance between (2, 3) and (6, 8) is \u221a((6 - 2)^2 + (8 - 3)^2) = \u221a(16 + 25) = \u221a41.\n\nTopic: Angles and Measurement\nExplanation: Angles are formed by two rays that have a common endpoint, called the vertex. Angles can be measured in degrees or radians, with a full circle being 360 degrees or 2\u03c0 radians.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe formula for converting degrees to radians is given by radians = (degrees \\* \u03c0) / 180. For example, 90 degrees is equal to (90 \\* \u03c0) / 180 = \u03c0 / 2 radians.\n\nTopic: Congruent and Similar Figures\nExplanation: Congruent figures are figures that have the same size and shape. Similar figures are figures that have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size.\nFormula and example:\n\nTwo triangles are similar if and only if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding side lengths are proportional. For example, two triangles with angles measuring 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 degrees respectively are similar, even though they are different in size.\n\nTopic: Perimeter, Area, and Volume\nExplanation: Perimeter is the distance around a figure, while area is the measure of the amount of space inside a figure. Volume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional figure.\nFormula and example:\n\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is given by A = (base \\* height) / 2. For example, the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 7 units is (5 \\* 7) / 2 = 17.5 square units.\n\nTopic: Proofs\nExplanation: Proofs are logical arguments used to establish the truth of mathematical statements. In geometry, proofs often involve using axioms and theorems to deduce new statements about figures.\nFormula and example:\n\nA proof that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nGiven: Triangle ABC\n\nProve: \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = 180\u00b0\n\nStep 1: Draw a straight line from point A to point C, and label it line segment AC.\nStep 2: Draw a straight line from point C to point B, and label it line segment CB.\nStep 3: Observe that line segments AC and CB form a straight line, meaning that they form a straight angle (180\u00b0).\nStep 4: By definition, the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to the sum of the angles in a straight line (180\u00b0).\nStep 5: Therefore, \u2220A + \u2220B + \u2220C = \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0, and the proof is complete.\n\nThis is a brief summary of some of the topics typically covered in high school geometry, including points, lines"}]}

South Korea announced on Monday that it plans to launch its own sixth-generation (6G) network in 2028. As part of the K-Network 2030 plan, South Korea will secure \"world-class\" 6G technologies, innovate the \"software-based next-generation mobile network\" and strengthen the network supply chain.\n\nSimultaneously, the government will incentivize local companies to produce equipment, parts, and materials for 6G technology in South Korea. It will also develop an open radio access network that is compatible with any device and enables mobile carriers and enterprises to provide flexible services.\n\nTo make all of these possible, South Korea is conducting a feasibility study for a research and development project on core 6G technologies. The project is worth 625.3 billion won (~US$482 million).\n\nAccording to the country's Ministry of Science and ICT, the country is carrying out these efforts in a bid to secure an early dominance of the future wireless frequencies. The plan is also aimed at helping the country retain its position in the global competition for future network infrastructure. A report by IP intelligence company IPlytics found that while 4G technology development was mostly dominated by U.S. and European companies, South Korean companies took the lead in 5G development.\n\nWhat's more, South Korea accounted for 25.9% of the number of 5G patents last year. It aims to reach 30% or over in the 6G patent competition.\n\nAside from South Korea, India also aims to launch 6G services before the end of this decade. The South Asian company already has a task force working to achieve the goal."}]}

The Hero\u2019s Journey is a structure that has been followed by some of the greatest stories ever told and ever lived.\n\nThe version of this journey described throughout the document is tailored for Kadence and is meant to serve as a reference point and a workspace for ideas, planning, and the execution of specialized tactics in order to continuously develop and progress the story which underlies the public representation of the ideas covered in this document.\n\nThe Journey, its associated ambitions, milestones, challenges, and gimmicks are experimental in nature, and thus are used to further our own research into the business of artist development, and quite possible leaving our mark on the World.\n\n## \\*\\*What is within this document?\\*\\*\n\nThis document contains a whole lot of useful information about characters, possible pathways of progression, theoretical understandings from The Hero\u2019s Journey, and much more. Overall, this document is a collection of all types of information that is relevant to the project undertakings described above.\n\n## \\*\\*How should this document be used?\\*\\*\n\nThis document should be seen strictly as an experimental guideline line used to plan and execute experimental content and plot lines with the intent of learning from experiment results and making changes to procedures in the future where necessary. With regards to content, the content database provided in this document will be used to visualize the potential timeline of events that will transpire once the official process has gone underway (ie. when the first piece of planned content is released to the public and the timeline must be adhered to.)\n\nIn addition to the content calendar, the document will be the gathering place for information deemed useful during the planning and execution process of projects such as the Docu-Series. This information serves to fuel the end-user content that is scheduled and created. By using the Hero\u2019s Journey as a guideline, maximum impact can be gradually attained via meticulous planning and execution of ordered story elements once it is distilled into its relevant parts here inside this document.\n\n## \\*\\*What is The Story\\*\\*\n\nThe Story is a character arch guideline for the Docu-series that is derived from the content of this page. It occurs over a discrete time period, subtly growing in both complexity and depth. The point of using a story is simple, it allows us as the creators of content to understand what type of activities, emotions, themes, places, people, and other story elements to include in order to progress the story, in film format, from a clear beginning to a decisive end without relying on specific events or in real life occurrences that might be outside of our control. By determining the characters in the story, as well as their personalities, aspirations, fears, hopes, and desires, we will be able to translate the implied reality of those characters into practical actions and plot points that can be made in the real world to add a touch of fantasy-like takeaways to the project.\n\nBy taking the time to understand both the created characters and their real life counterparts, we ensure maximum compatibility with your (you reading this document) own personal journey, as well as the journey of the characters within the story. This allows us to create a seamless and coherent narrative that will captivate and engage our audience, while also providing a meaningful and impactful experience for everyone involved.\n\nIn order to fully realize the potential of this project and to bring [The Story] to life, it is important to have a clear understanding of the key elements of The Hero\u2019s Journey, as well as an understanding of the specific goals and objectives of the project. With this information in hand, we can begin to craft a unique and compelling story that will capture the hearts and minds of our audience.\n\n### The Journey Ahead\n\nAs we embark on this journey, it is important to remember that this is an experiment and that the path ahead may be uncertain. However, by using The Hero\u2019s Journey as our guide, we can be sure to make the most of every opportunity that comes our way. With careful planning and execution, we can turn this project into something truly special and leave a lasting impact on the world.\n\"\n\n What is the next portion I should write?"}]}

Stop ! No more will you have this for an excuse.We'll be minting an arduino right here,right now,so grab the parts in step 2 of this instructable,sit tight,grab your coffee and lets get to it .\n\nStep 2: Get These Quick!\nGet These Quick!\nYou require these starting materials:\nBreadboard\nAtMega 328 IC (you can use any variant like 328 PU or 328 P-PU )\nConnecting wires,\nArduino(using an Duemilanove here),\n1x 16 Mhz crystal,\n3x 100 ohm resistors\n1x 10K resistor\n2x 22pF capacitors\n3x LED's(A red ,yellow led and a green one)\n1x 9v battery with connector snap,\n1x usb cable,\n1x 7805 Voltage Regulator\nA computer or a laptop with arduino ide installed,\nsome free time and will to make things work\n\nStep 3: Beginning the Assembly\nGrab your breadboard.It should look like the one in the picture perforated with lot of holes.\nPut the AtMega chip (one that looks like a centipede) right down the middle of the board,\nbut keeping it closer to any one of the ends.\n\nStep 4: Setting Up the Power Supply\nPlace the LM7805 voltage regular on the breadboard along with the ATMega 328 chip.\nThe pin placement of 7805 with the bulged side facing you is :Pin 1 - VCC, Pin 2 -Gnd, Pin 3 - Output.\nConnect a black wire to pin 2 of the 7805 .Connect the other end of wire to the gnd rail on the breadboard.\nSimilarly connect a red wire to pin 3 of the 7805 whose other end will go to the vcc rail on the breadboard.\nConnect a black wire to the ground rail which we'll connect with the ground of our Arduino(later).\nTo Connect the vcc and gnd rails along both the ends of the breadboard,connect 2 wires\nas shown in the last few figures.\n\nStep 5: Providing Power to the Chip\nTake a good look at the At-mega to Arduino pin mapping given .\nWe're going to wire the circuit following it, so taking a look at it before prototyping will come in handy.\nParticularly see the Vcc(+5V) and ground pin locations.\nConnect red wires to pins 7 and 20 of the chip to 5V rail on breadboard.\nConnect black wires to pins 8 and 22 of the chip to Gnd rail on breadboard.\n\nStep 6: Making the Clockwork..\nAdd a 22pF capacitor between the Ground and pin 9 on the Atmega328 IC.\nAdd another 22pF capacitor between pin 10 of Atmega328 IC and ground.\nFinally add a 16 Mhz crystal between pins 9 and 10 on the Atmega328.\nAdd a 10k ohm resistor between the 5V and reset(pin1) of the 328 IC.\nYour setup should now look similar to figure 4,5 of this step.\n\nStep 7: Adding in the Status LED's\nAdd a wire on any one side of breadboard.\nConnect a 100 ohm resistor to one of the ends where you connected the wire.(See pics).\nAdd the longer lead(+ve) of yellow led to the other end of resistor.\nConnect the shorter leg(-ve) of the led to ground.\nDo the above steps for red and green led's.\n\nStep 8: Connecting Everyting With the Arduino\nYou're almost there!\nConnect the yellow led wire to pin 9 of the arduino.\nThis functions as \"Heartbeat\". It shows the programmer is running.\nConnect the red led wire to pin 8 of the arduino.\nThis functions as \"Error indicator\". It lights up if anything goes wrong.\nConnect the green led wire to pin 7 of the arduino.\nThis functions as \"Programming in Progress\". It shows the programmer(Ardiuno) is in communication with the slave(ATMega 328 on breadboard).\nConnect 4 wires(3yellow and a green one) to pins on the Atmega IC on the breadboard\naccording to the pictorial schematic above..and connect them to pins 10,11,12,13on the arduino.\nAlso don't forget to attach the +5V and ground wires between the Arduino board and the breadboard.\n\nStep 9: Programming Your Arduino\nLet me tell what were going to do here.We're going to make your arduino basically burn the bootloader\nonto the new Atmega 328 chip on the breadboard.\nWell, we'll be burning a program into our arduino to make it behave like a programmer!\n1) Start the Arduino IDE.\n2) Go to File > Examples > Arduino ISP.\n3) Compile the sketch and burn it into your Arduino.\nAfter you've burned the sketch,you'll see that the yellow LED will start to pulsate.\nIf it doesn't,check your connections again.Don't proceed further until you get this to work.\nNow add a 100 ohm resistance between the 5V and the reset pin on the Arduino.\nThis is to disable the auto-rest which occurs on the Arduino.\n\nStep 10: Setting Up the Burning...and Rise of an Arduino\nTools > Board > Arduino Duemilanove with AtMega328.\nProgrammer > Arduino as ISP.\nGo to the tools menu and finally select the \"Burn Bootloader\" option.\nArduino IDE should now read : Burning bootloader, and if all went well the green led should come on.\nThe Tx and Rx pins on the Arduino should start flashing.\nThis process of burning the bootloader will take about a minute to complete.\nArduino IDE should now read : Done Burning bootloader\nIf it does,work done,Congrats,you now have a new Arduino chip.\nIf you had an Error, the RED led should come up.But don't fret.\nMatch your error type with the debugging guide in the coming steps.\n\nStep 11: Troubleshooting Guide\nSee the pics of this step and Eliminate your problem.\nRemember that you may have multiple errors and after you solve one error ,you may tumble into the next one.\nBut just follow the solution corresponding to the error and you'll be up and running in no time.\nIf you liked this tutorial or are having problems,post comments below.\nCheers and Happy building.\n\nPlease write in English language."}]}
{"timestamp": 3742, "requests": [{"Prompt Length": 2522, "Output Length": 25, "prompt": "Sally\u2019s basic problem, in my view, is behavioral. That is, she has not been taking care of herself while she has been taking care of business. She has put on a ton of weight, to begin with, which hasn\u2019t helped. And she has had a lot of pain. Interestingly (and familiarly to me), the fear of its onset has been almost as bad as the pain itself. That hasn\u2019t helped her business either, she says. Like Fit Fred, she reads off the list of things her medical doctor says are wrong with her with something approaching pride. And, sure enough, the list goes on for quite a while. She has central stenosis, foraminal stenosis (that\u2019s what the second operation was for, but it\u2019s back), bone spurs (bony growths like calluses, but on the bone), and good old spondylolisthesis (a slippage of one vertebra over another, which hurts). \nOf the four surgeries she has had, the most recent two, the fusion and the laminectomy, relieved some of her debilitating leg and foot pain for a while, but serious back pain remains, along with intermittent bouts of buttock and leg pain when she walks. We talk about her postsurgical physical therapy. It helped somewhat while she was doing it but the lower back pain always came back. Now everything she does hurts. Walking, sitting, standing, you name it. She scoffs when I ask about resuming an exercise regimen. \u201cThat, sir, is impossible.\u201d Well, we\u2019ll see.\nI start by asking her to get up on the table and lie on her back. Not so fast, she says. That is almost beyond her. She weighs an awful lot and every move hurts. It is not easy for her to get on the table, and she doesn\u2019t like it. I help her, but I weigh only about 150; I can see her thinking to herself, \u201cMaybe a bigger therapist?\u201d But we get there. Once she settles into the position on her back, I ask her to bend her knees and put her feet flat on the table. Same thing I told myself to do, that day of my back spasm. It hurts, she says. I ignore that, and tell her to move her legs up and down as if marching in place, bringing the knees up toward the torso. Does this make your back hurt? Of course it does. But\u2014sneaky, I know\u2014she is getting used to the idea that I think it\u2019s going to be possible for her to move in this position, which is true. Okay, I say, let\u2019s lessen the range of motion a lot. Now just barely lift your feet off of the table. Does this make your back hurt? Yes. Growing frustration. \nNow I shift gears and, for the next fifteen minutes, I talk to her about finding her neutral spine. She does. Then I ask her to tighten the muscles in her abdomen, which\u2014God bless her\u2014she finally does. I\u2019m getting off track and talking a bit about the beginning of therapy, I know, but therapy and diagnosis are inseparable in her case. \nThen I have her do the marching in place again, but with those muscles engaged. Does that hurt? \u201cNo,\u201d she says with surprise. And darned if she doesn\u2019t brighten a little. A wisp of pleasure or relief comes across her face. Huh! \nI tell her that she has just crossed the Rubicon. We have begun on the road to a cure. It is going to be long and hard, but my guess is that we are going to get there. \u201cYeah?\u201d she asks, not daring to believe it. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI believe we are. No guarantees and a lot of work for you. But my guess is that you\u2019ve been a worker all your life, that you\u2019ll work at this and that you will make it. Yes.\u201d She is plenty skeptical, but she smiles, too. \nI explain that if she can move her legs without pain in her back while lying down then she can eventually do it upright. And that is called walking. It has been a while since she was able to walk without pain, and there have been plenty of days when she couldn\u2019t walk at all. I push her to do a little more, but that little march is all she can do for now. Fine, that\u2019s where we start. \nThere can be a serious, psychological component in all this, and it was very serious indeed with Sally. She had become deeply scared of movement. Any and all movement because any movement hurts. Her default solution has been not to move at all. Worse than that, her real solution in recent times has been to sit on the sofa and drink quite a bit of white wine. It worked, in a way, but was disastrous, too. It has given her this hideous weight problem. It hasn\u2019t made her very good company, and it has been brutal for her business. But she didn\u2019t hurt when doing that. So she sat on the couch for many hours a day, doing some business and quite a lot of drinking. My complicated task\u2014and the book may not be much help on this one\u2014was to wean her from the sofa-and-wine solution and get her into the movement solution. I was cautiously optimistic. Justifiably optimistic, it turns out. She is a proud woman and had a right to be. I thought that that fact and the early easing of pain just might do the job.\nSally and I have been at it for six months and she has done remarkably well. We are not there yet, but she has made terrific progress, her spirits are much improved, and her drinking much abated. Six months into our work, she is walking with her spouse around the neighborhood at night without much pain. She is playing with her grandchildren. She is going to the movies. She goes to the office rather than having everything brought to her at home. And she is doing serious (for her) strength training! She sees all this as a near-miracle and is charmingly grateful. Is she totally pain-free? No. She may never be. Does she have her life back? Yes, quite a bit of it, anyway. I want to see her make more progress. She thinks what has happened thus far is extraordinary.\nTHE GATEWAY THEORY OF PAIN \nHere is a little anecdote about the walking-in-place solution with which so many cures begin. A big reason for the reduction of pain is that tensing the abdominal muscles in the right way keeps the spine from moving and causing irritation. But, another reason is that it is a simple distraction from pain, to get the patient to focus on movement. We have gateways or pathways over which pain moves to the brain, and they have a limited capacity. One of the things about the walking-in-place phenomenon is that the \u201creports\u201d of this activity to the brain take up a fair amount of neural space and block the gateways. There is less room for the pain reports to get through. So they don\u2019t. Some do, of course, but fewer. Thus, the simple business of walking-in-place, which serves many functions, blocks the pain highway and lessens the sense of pain. Sounds trifling but it works. It\u2019s like the nurse pinching the spot where she\u2019s going to give you the shot: she wants to keep you busy. Your neural pathways, anyway.\nRegular Robert \nOn the fitness scale, Regular Robert was somewhere in the middle. In terms of his lifestyle and temperament, he was a lunatic. Like a lot of my patients here in Aspen, he is successful, a strong alpha personality, a serious workaholic, and a handful. He thinks he\u2019s a fitness guy but his idea of fitness is getting on the treadmill for forty-five minutes a day while reading his emails. This is not my idea of fitness; this is my idea of fooling around. And it is largely useless for someone with real back issues. The rest of his day is spent in intense meetings, traveling, and (especially) bent over his computer. Recently, he has had a relatively sudden onset of pretty serious lower back and buttock pain. It is nowhere near as severe as what I had or what most of the other people in this chapter had, but it\u2019s serious enough, and he\u2019s not liking it one bit. So here he sits, in my office, looking cranky. Everyone I see looks cranky. \nI listen to his story and determine it is likely a bulging lumbar disc. Do you remember those terms? Lumbar means lower back, where almost all back pain resides. And a disc is a disc. The reasons behind my conclusion are fairly straightforward and you can probably follow the analysis yourself, if you have similar problems. By asking him to move some, I find that he gets more pain with flexion (forward bending at the waist), sitting, and lifting. The pain eases with standing, extension (backward bending at the waist), and moving. The pain radiates down into his buttocks and can go from severe to almost nonexistent in the same day. The pain is more severe in the back than in the buttock or leg. I believe that it is a bulge (the outer fibers of the disc are still mostly intact) and not a herniation or rupture because the pain would be more severe if it were a rupture, and it would likely be radiating down his leg. \nThe pain is positional, meaning it gets better or worse depending on the position he is in. The pain goes from fairly intense to fairly mild, sometimes within hours, and he is not complaining of any numbness in his leg or foot. When the disc is herniated, it is common for the pain to be constant regardless of position and there is apt to be accompanying numbness or tingling in the foot or leg. The pain is also commonly the most intense in the leg or foot and not the back. I tell him I think he has a bulging disc and I explain just what that means. Type A guy that he is, he immediately wants to talk about surgery\u2014about getting this fixed! Right now. \u201cHow bad is the surgery? How long is the recovery?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho should I use and how soon can I schedule it?\u201d \nI tell him to chill for a minute; we are nowhere near that point yet. There are various stages of disc dysfunction, I tell him, and his does not look that bad to me. I say this because my exam shows no neurological damage. Here\u2019s what I mean. I tapped his Achilles tendon and his foot jerked sharply, a sign that there has been no nerve damage in that area. I do the same with his knee (the same spot your doctor taps when you have a physical): same result. His reflexes are normal, so likely no nerve damage. His strength is within normal range, too. \nIf you have even a hint of \u201cradicular\u201d pain\u2014pain that goes down your leg\u2014you should see a medical doctor. It could be pain from an irritated nerve root (which can be serious) or it could be referred muscular pain. The analysis is a bit too complicated to cover in a book. In any event, I conclude that Regular Robert has not suffered any motor nerve damage because of nerve compression and he has not suffered any loss of strength. In the absence of serious motor function or nerve loss, surgery is seldom called for. \nLet me repeat this: Self-assessment gets tricky when it comes to muscle and nerve loss. If you sense that you are anywhere near that territory, especially if you have possible radicular pain (pain going down your leg), you should get professional help, probably a medical doctor. \nRegular Robert does not have nerve or muscle loss so he is not likely to have suffered a herniation. He is lucky, in a way, to have come in with this problem at this stage. It will give him a not-so-gentle kick in the pants to take spine health seriously. And it will give me a chance to offer him major relief, if not an outright cure. If he is serious and does what he must."}]}

Research Collaboration
======================

At AIBrix, we strongly support system-level research and are committed to fostering collaboration with researchers and academics in the AI infrastructure domain.
Our platform provides a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world production challenges.
If you're a PhD student or researcher looking to explore innovative ideas in AI systems, we'd love to support your work.

Opportunities for Research
--------------------------

- **Unresolved Production Challenges**: The AI production environment presents numerous unresolved problems, from efficient resource allocation to scalable inference architectures. We can provide case studies and real-world scenarios for researchers interested in exploring and solving these challenges.

- **Research Paper Implementation**: Some research ideas have been integrated into AIBrix, making it a practical landing ground for cutting-edge innovations. We regularly publish `Help Wanted <https://github.com/vllm-project/aibrix/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22>`_ issues on our GitHub, highlighting open research opportunities—feel free to take a look and contribute!

- **AIBrix as a Research Testbed**: Our system is designed to serve as a research testbed for system-level problems in AI infrastructure. Whether it's testing new scheduling algorithms, optimizing inference latency, or improving resource efficiency, we provide hands-on support to help set up experiments and validate hypotheses.

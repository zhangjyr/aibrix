Gateway Routing
===============

The AIBrix gateway is built on Envoy Gateway and acts as the single entry point for all LLM inference requests. It handles dynamic model discovery, request routing, rate limiting, and response streaming. For a deep dive into the internal design, see the `AIBrix Router <../designs/aibrix-router.html>`_ architecture guide.

Dynamic Routing
---------------

When a model or LoRA adapter is deployed, the respective controller automatically creates an ``HTTPRoute`` object. The gateway dynamically discovers these routes to forward incoming requests without any manual configuration.

First, retrieve the external IP and port of the Envoy proxy:

.. code-block:: bash

    NAME                                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                   AGE
    envoy-aibrix-system-aibrix-eg-903790dc   LoadBalancer   10.96.239.246   101.18.0.4    80:32079/TCP                              10d
    envoy-gateway                            ClusterIP      10.96.166.226   <none>        18000/TCP,18001/TCP,18002/TCP,19001/TCP   10d

In most Kubernetes setups, ``LoadBalancer`` is supported by default. Capture the external IP:

.. code-block:: bash

    LB_IP=$(kubectl get svc/envoy-aibrix-system-aibrix-eg-903790dc -n envoy-gateway-system -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    ENDPOINT="${LB_IP}:80"

Verify that the ``HTTPRoute`` status is ``Accepted`` before sending traffic:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kubectl get httproute -A
    NAMESPACE       NAME                                  HOSTNAMES   AGE

    aibrix-system   deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b-router               14m # created for each model deployment
    ....

.. code-block:: bash

As of v0.5.0, each model's ``HTTPRoute`` is created with a default set of path prefixes (e.g. ``/v1/chat/completions``, ``/v1/completions``). To expose additional custom paths, add the ``model.aibrix.ai/model-router-custom-paths`` annotation to your ``Deployment``, ``ModelAdapter``, or ``RayClusterFleet`` manifest:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
        model.aibrix.ai/name: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b
        model.aibrix.ai/port: "8000"
      annotations:
        model.aibrix.ai/model-router-custom-paths: /version,/score # comma-separated; spaces and empty entries are ignored
      name: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b
      namespace: default

The model name in the request body must match the ``model.aibrix.ai/name`` label in your deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -v http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
        "temperature": 0.7
    }'

.. attention::

    AIBrix exposes a public endpoint to the internet. Enable authentication to secure it.
    For vLLM backends, pass the ``--api-key`` argument or set the ``VLLM_API_KEY`` environment variable to require an API key in the ``Authorization`` header.
    See `vLLM OpenAI-Compatible Server <https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html#openai-compatible-server>`_ for details.

After enabling authentication, include the ``Authorization`` header in every request:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -v http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer any_key" \
    -d '{
        "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
        "temperature": 0.7
    }'


Routing Strategies
------------------

The routing strategy controls how the gateway selects the target pod for each request. It can be set per-request via the ``routing-strategy`` header, or globally via the ``ROUTING_ALGORITHM`` environment variable.

Some strategies rely on metrics queried from the Prometheus HTTP API (PromQL). See `Prometheus API Access <../production/observability.html#prometheus-api-access>`_ for configuration.

General load balancing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``random``: routes to a randomly selected pod. Suitable as a baseline or when all pods are equivalent.
* ``least-request``: routes to the pod with the fewest in-flight requests.
* ``least-busy-time``: routes to the pod with the least cumulative busy processing time.
* ``least-latency``: routes to the pod with the lowest average processing latency.
* ``least-kv-cache``: routes to the pod with the smallest KV cache occupancy (least VRAM used).
* ``least-gpu-cache``: routes to the pod with the lowest GPU cache utilization.
* ``least-utilization``: routes to the pod with the lowest overall utilization score.
* ``load-balance``: capacity-aware weighted least-request routing. Scores each pod as ``running_requests / drain_rate`` (pending time), where ``drain_rate`` is the observed request completion rate. Selects the pod with the lowest pending time, breaking ties using least combined GPU+CPU KV-cache usage (falling back to a random pick if cache metrics are unavailable for the tied pods). Falls back to uniform capacity (``drain_rate = 1``) when metrics are unavailable. Its load-imbalance gate, which restricts candidates to the least-loaded pods when load is severely skewed, is applied centrally by the gateway ahead of whichever strategy actually routes each request — not just when ``load-balance`` itself is selected (see ``pkg/plugins/gateway/ENV_VARS.md``).
* ``throughput``: routes to the pod that has processed the fewest total weighted tokens, favoring underloaded pods.
* ``power-of-two``: applies power-of-two-choices — randomly samples two pods and selects the better one.

KV-cache aware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``prefix-cache``: routes to a pod that already holds a KV cache matching the request's prompt prefix, selecting the best prefix-matched pod within a configurable stddev threshold. Purely about prefix caching — it does not itself gate on cluster-wide load imbalance (the gateway applies that gate centrally ahead of it; see ``load-balance`` above). Supports two modes: standard (local hash table) and KV sync (real-time distributed index via ``AIBRIX_PREFIX_CACHE_KV_EVENT_SYNC_ENABLED=true``).
* ``prefix-cache-preble``: routes considering both prefix cache hits and pod load, based on `Preble: Efficient Distributed Prompt Scheduling for LLM Serving <https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00023>`_.

Fairness
^^^^^^^^

* ``vtc-basic``: routes using a hybrid score that balances per-user token fairness and pod utilization. A simplified variant of the Virtual Token Counter (VTC) algorithm. See `VTC-artifact <https://github.com/Ying1123/VTC-artifact>`_ for background.

SLO-aware
^^^^^^^^^

* ``slo``: routes with awareness of per-request service-level objectives.
* ``slo-pack-load``: SLO-aware routing that consolidates load onto fewer pods.
* ``slo-least-load``: SLO-aware routing that spreads load to the least loaded pod.
* ``slo-least-load-pulling``: variant of ``slo-least-load`` that pulls metrics directly instead of using cached snapshots.

Specialized
^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``pd``: prefill-decode disaggregation routing. Splits processing between dedicated prefill pods and decode pods for optimized end-to-end latency.

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -v http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "routing-strategy: pd" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
          "model": "your-model-name",
          "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
          "temperature": 0.7
      }'

* ``session-affinity``: sticky session routing. Encodes the target pod's address (``IP:Port``) as a base64 value in the ``x-session-id`` response header. Subsequent requests that include this header are routed to the same pod. If that pod is no longer available, the gateway transparently fails over to a new pod and issues a fresh session ID.

  How it works:

  - On the first request (no ``x-session-id``), the gateway picks a ready pod and returns an ``x-session-id`` response header.
  - The client stores and resends this header on follow-up requests (e.g., in multi-turn conversations).
  - The gateway decodes the session ID to recover the original pod address and routes to it.
  - If the pod is unavailable (scaled down or evicted), it falls over to a new pod and issues a new session ID.

  .. note::
      ``x-session-id`` encodes only network location. It is not a security token and must not be used for authentication or authorization.

      Callers can instead send a stable, opaque ``x-aibrix-session-key`` value. The gateway consistently maps that value to a ready pod without exposing a backend address. The key is only used when ``routing-strategy`` is ``session-affinity`` and must not be used for authentication or authorization.

  .. code-block:: bash

      curl -v http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "routing-strategy: session-affinity" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
          "model": "your-model-name",
          "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
          "temperature": 0.7
      }'

Auto-blended capacity awareness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This auto-blend is **enabled by default** — no opt-in is required. Every strategy above, except
the exclusive ones (``pd``, ``slo``/``slo-*``) and an explicit standalone ``load-balance``
selection, silently gets ``load-balance``'s capacity-aware scoring blended in behind the scenes —
and ``least-request`` too, when the selected strategy doesn't already route by request count, to
keep multi-port/data-parallel pod routing working under the blend. The caller never sees this:
``ctx.Algorithm``, response headers, and ``Validate()`` all still reflect exactly the strategy
that was requested. This keeps any single strategy from steering traffic at an already-hot pod
even outside the load-imbalance gate described above. Both blend weights default to ``1`` (see
``pkg/plugins/gateway/ENV_VARS.md``); set ``AIBRIX_ROUTING_AUTO_BLEND_LOAD_BALANCE_WEIGHT=0`` to
disable it.

To override the strategy for a single request, pass the ``routing-strategy`` header with any of the values above:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -v http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "routing-strategy: least-request" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "your-model-name",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
        "temperature": 0.7
    }'


Rate Limiting
-------------

The gateway supports per-user rate limiting on requests per minute (RPM) and tokens per minute (TPM). Pass the ``user`` header with a unique identifier to enable rate-limit enforcement for that client.

For details on managing users, see the `User Management documentation <https://github.com/vllm-project/aibrix/blob/main/pkg/metadata/README.md>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -v http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "user: your-user-id" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer any_key" \
    -d '{
        "model": "your-model-name",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
        "temperature": 0.7
    }'

.. note::
    If rate limiting is not needed, the ``user`` header can be omitted.


External Filter
---------------

The ``external-filter`` header restricts the candidate pod pool using Kubernetes label selector syntax before the routing strategy makes its final selection. It is evaluated before routing and only takes effect when a ``routing-strategy`` is also set.

Supported selector forms:

- ``key=value``
- ``key in (a, b)``
- ``key!=value``
- comma-separated list of selectors

See the `Kubernetes label selector reference <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/>`_ for the full syntax.

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -v http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "routing-strategy: random" \
      -H "external-filter: environment=production,tier=frontend" \
      -d '{
            "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b",
            "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
            "max_tokens": 128,
            "temperature": 0
          }'

.. note::

    1. Filtering happens **before** the routing strategy and does not change which pod the strategy considers optimal.
    2. ``external-filter`` only takes effect when ``routing-strategy`` is set.
    3. It further narrows down the pods already selected by ``model.aibrix.ai/name``.
    4. If the filter eliminates all pods, the request fails with ``no ready pods for routing``.
    5. ``external-filter`` is optional. When omitted, no extra filtering is applied.

Debugging Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Identify error headers** — inspect ``x-error-routing``, ``x-error-user``, ``x-error-response-unmarshal``, and ``x-error-response-unknown`` to locate the root cause. For request body issues, check ``x-error-request-body-processing`` and ``x-error-no-model-in-request``.

2. **Verify routing and model assignment** — confirm ``target-pod`` is set. If ``x-error-no-model-in-request`` or ``x-error-no-model-backends`` appears, verify the request body includes a valid model name and that the model has active backend pods. If ``x-error-invalid-routing-strategy`` is present, confirm the strategy name is supported.

3. **Diagnose streaming issues** — check ``x-error-streaming`` and ``x-error-stream``. If usage statistics are missing from a streaming response, inspect ``x-error-no-stream-options-include-usage``.

4. **Investigate rate limiting** — if a request was rejected, check ``x-error-rpm-exceeded`` or ``x-error-tpm-exceeded``. If counters failed to update, look for ``x-error-incr-rpm`` or ``x-error-incr-tpm``. Successful updates are indicated by ``x-update-rpm`` and ``x-update-tpm``.

Verify that all gateway objects have ``status.conditions == Accepted``:

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl describe gatewayclass -n aibrix-system

    kubectl describe gateway -n aibrix-system

    kubectl describe envoypatchpolicy -n aibrix-system

    # check for all objects
    kubectl describe envoyextensionpolicy -n aibrix-system

    # check for all objects
    kubectl describe httproute -n aibrix-system

Collect logs from the Envoy proxy and the gateway plugin for deeper investigation:

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl get pods -n envoy-gateway-system

    NAME                                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

.. _observability_telemetry:

Observability & Telemetry
-------------------------

The gateway plugins feature built-in support for distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry (OTel). This allows you to trace end-to-end request lifecycles across the external processing pipeline.

Tracing is strictly opt-in by default to conserve system resources. To enable the telemetry components, you need to complete the following two steps:

Step 1: Enable OpenTelemetry in EnvoyProxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable ``openTelemetry.enable`` in your helm chart or add the telemetry configuration directly to your ``EnvoyProxy`` resource.

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
    kind: EnvoyProxy
    metadata:
      name: aibrix-custom-proxy-config
    spec:
      telemetry:
        tracing:
          samplingRate: 100
          provider:
            type: OpenTelemetry
            openTelemetry:
              # -- The hostname or IP address of the OpenTelemetry Collector/OTLP receiver.
              # Do NOT include the protocol scheme (e.g., http://) or port here.
              host: "otel-collector.monitoring.svc.cluster.local"

              # -- The port of the OTLP gRPC receiver (Envoy strictly uses gRPC for this).
              port: 4317

Step 2: Configure the OTLP Exporter Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you must explicitly configure an OTLP exporter endpoint in your environment. You can enable it by setting either the global endpoint or the traces-specific endpoint.

For example, if you are running a cluster local OTel Collector, inject the following environment variables:

.. code-block:: yaml

    env:
      # Option 1: Global OTLP endpoint (Recommended)
      # NOTE: If protocol is HTTP, the SDK automatically appends '/v1/traces' to this URL.
      # If protocol is gRPC, it uses the base URL as-is.
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: "http://otel-collector.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4317"

      # --- OR ---

      # Option 2: Traces-specific endpoint (Uncomment to use instead of Option 1)
      # The SDK uses this URL EXACTLY as-is without appending any paths.
      # (Example below uses port 4318 for HTTP/Protobuf exports)
      # - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT
      #   value: "http://otel-collector.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:4318/v1/traces"

      # Specifies the transport protocol. Valid options: grpc, http, or http/protobuf
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL
        value: "grpc"

      # Keeps TLS active but skips server certificate validation (useful for self-signed certs)
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY
        value: "true"

      # Set Headers if your OTel Collector or APM backend (e.g., Datadog, Honeycomb) requires authentication
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
        value: "Authorization=Bearer {{ token }}"

**Advanced Configuration**

.. _config_profiles:

Config Profiles
---------------

A **config profile** lets you embed routing settings directly in a model's pod annotation, so every request to that model picks up the right configuration automatically. You can define multiple named profiles in one annotation and switch between them per-request with a single header.

**Setting up a profile**

Add the ``model.aibrix.ai/config`` annotation to the pod template of your ``Deployment``, ``StormService``, or ``RayClusterFleet``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    annotations:
      model.aibrix.ai/config: |
        {
          "defaultProfile": "default",
          "profiles": {
            "default": {
              "routingStrategy": "least-request",
              "requestsPerSecond": 200
            },
            "large-input": {
              "routingStrategy": "pd",
              "routingConfig": {
                "promptLenBucketMinLength": 8192,
                "promptTokensGte": 8192,
                "prefillScorePolicy": "prefix_cache",
                "decodeScorePolicy": "load_balancing"
              },
              "requestsPerSecond": 50
            },
            "cache-friendly": {
              "routingStrategy": "least-kv-cache",
              "requestsPerSecond": 150
            },
            "offline-generation": {
              "routingStrategy": "throughput",
              "routingConfig": {
                "maxTokensGte": 2048
              }
            }
          }
        }

Optionally pin a single routing strategy model-wide so it cannot be overridden at
request time (see Routing strategy priority below). ``lockedRoutingStrategy`` only
locks the strategy: the remaining per-profile knobs (``requestsPerSecond``,
``routingConfig``) still follow the profile selected by ``config-profile``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    annotations:
      model.aibrix.ai/config: |
        {
          "lockedRoutingStrategy": "pd",
          "defaultProfile": "default",
          "profiles": {
            "default": {
              "routingStrategy": "pd"
            },
            "batch": {
              "routingStrategy": "random",
              "requestsPerSecond": 50
            }
          }
        }

**Selecting a profile at request time**

Two request headers drive the config at request time:

* ``config-profile`` selects a named profile; when absent, ``defaultProfile`` (or ``"default"``) is used. ``config-profile: auto`` asks the gateway to select a concrete profile from request-local hints in each profile's ``routingConfig``.
* ``routing-strategy`` overrides the selected profile's ``routingStrategy``, unless ``lockedRoutingStrategy`` is set (see Routing strategy priority below).

.. code-block:: bash

    # Use the "batch" profile for this request
    curl http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "config-profile: batch" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"model": "my-model", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize..."}]}'

.. code-block:: bash

    # Let the gateway resolve a concrete profile from routingConfig hints
    curl http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "config-profile: auto" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"model": "my-model", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize..."}], "max_tokens": 4096}'

**Top-level fields**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - ``lockedRoutingStrategy``
     - Pins a single routing strategy model-wide. When set, it takes precedence over the ``routing-strategy`` header, the per-profile ``routingStrategy`` and the ``ROUTING_ALGORITHM`` env. The remaining per-profile knobs (``requestsPerSecond``, ``routingConfig``) are still applied normally.
   * - ``defaultProfile``
     - Profile name used when no ``config-profile`` header is sent. Falls back to ``"default"`` when omitted.
   * - ``profiles``
     - Map of named profiles, each carrying the per-profile fields below.

**Profile fields**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - ``routingStrategy``
     - The routing algorithm for this profile (e.g. ``least-latency``, ``prefix-cache``, ``pd``). See the Routing Strategies section above for the full list.
   * - ``requestsPerSecond``
     - Model-level RPS cap for this profile. Requests that exceed the limit are rejected with HTTP 429. Omit or set to ``0`` for no limit. See `Production Model Deployments <../production/model-deployment.html>`_ for details.
   * - ``routingConfig``
     - Algorithm-specific settings as a nested JSON object. ``config-profile: auto`` also reads request-local selection hints from this object. Currently supported auto-selection hints are ``promptTokensGte``, ``promptTokensLt``, ``maxTokensGte`` and ``maxTokensLt``. Existing strategy-specific fields, such as ``promptLenBucketMinLength`` for ``pd``, remain available. See `Prefill-Decode Disaggregation <pd-disaggregation.html>`_ for details.

When ``config-profile: auto`` is used, the gateway evaluates the supported
request-local hints inside each profile's ``routingConfig``. A profile matches
only when all of its supported hints match the request. If no profile matches,
the gateway uses ``defaultProfile`` (or ``"default"``). ``promptTokens*`` uses
the gateway's existing prompt text extraction and local token estimation.
``maxTokens*`` reads ``max_tokens`` first, then ``max_completion_tokens`` when
``max_tokens`` is absent.

**Routing strategy priority** (highest to lowest):

1. ``lockedRoutingStrategy`` pinned model-wide in the config — always wins when set, even over the ``routing-strategy`` header.
2. ``routing-strategy`` request header.
3. ``routingStrategy`` from the resolved profile. The resolved profile comes from the concrete ``config-profile`` header, ``config-profile: auto`` routingConfig hints, or ``defaultProfile``.
4. ``ROUTING_ALGORITHM`` environment variable on the gateway plugin.

**Backward compatibility**: if a pod has no ``model.aibrix.ai/config`` annotation, the gateway falls back to the ``routing-strategy`` request header and then the ``ROUTING_ALGORITHM`` env (steps 2 and 4 above). No migration is required for existing deployments.

.. _prometheus-api-access:

Prometheus API Access
---------------------

Some routing strategies rely on metrics queried from the Prometheus HTTP API (PromQL). Configure the endpoint and optional Basic Auth credentials with the following environment variables.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 18 60

   * - Environment Variable
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT``
     - (empty)
     - Prometheus HTTP API base URL (e.g. ``http://prometheus-operated.prometheus.svc:9090``). If empty, PromQL-based metrics are skipped.
   * - ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_NAME``
     - (empty)
     - Kubernetes Secret name containing Basic Auth credentials. When set, takes precedence over the plaintext env vars below.
   * - ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_NAMESPACE``
     - ``aibrix-system``
     - Namespace of the Secret specified by ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_NAME``.
   * - ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME_KEY``
     - ``username``
     - Key in ``Secret.data`` used as the Basic Auth username.
   * - ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_KEY``
     - ``password``
     - Key in ``Secret.data`` used as the Basic Auth password.
   * - ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME``
     - (empty)
     - Basic Auth username. Used only when ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_NAME`` is not set.
   * - ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD``
     - (empty)
     - Basic Auth password. Used only when ``PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_NAME`` is not set.

Example (plaintext env vars)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   export PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT="http://prometheus-operated.prometheus.svc:9090"
   export PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME="prom_user"
   export PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="prom_pass"

Example (Kubernetes Secret)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: prometheus-basic-auth
     namespace: aibrix-system
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     username: prom_user
     password: prom_pass

.. code-block:: bash

   export PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT="http://prometheus-operated.prometheus.svc:9090"
   export PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_NAME="prometheus-basic-auth"
   export PROMETHEUS_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_NAMESPACE="aibrix-system"

Message Size Configuration
---------------------------

Two independent size limits apply to requests flowing through the gateway. Both default to **4 MiB** and must be kept in sync when you raise or lower the limit.

Gateway Plugin gRPC Buffer (``AIBRIX_GRPC_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_BYTES``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Envoy communicates with the AIBrix gateway plugin over an external-processing (ext_proc) gRPC connection. This env var controls the maximum size of a single gRPC message on that connection. Requests or responses larger than this value are rejected before they reach routing logic.

Configure it under ``gatewayPlugin.envs`` in ``values.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   gatewayPlugin:
     envs:
       AIBRIX_GRPC_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_BYTES: "4194304"  # 4 MiB

Envoy Connection Buffer (``clientTrafficPolicy.connection.bufferLimit``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Envoy itself buffers each incoming HTTP connection up to ``bufferLimit`` bytes before it begins processing. If a request body exceeds this limit Envoy returns a ``413`` before the ext_proc filter is even invoked.

Configure it under ``envoyGateway.clientTrafficPolicy`` in ``values.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   envoyGateway:
     clientTrafficPolicy:
       connection:
         bufferLimit: 4194304  # 4 MiB

Keeping the two values in sync
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because Envoy drops the connection before the gateway plugin sees it when ``bufferLimit`` is the binding limit, both values should always be set to the same size. When you need to support larger payloads (e.g. large KV-cache state-sync messages), update **both** fields together:

.. code-block:: yaml

   gatewayPlugin:
     envs:
       AIBRIX_GRPC_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_BYTES: "16777216"  # 16 MiB

   envoyGateway:
     clientTrafficPolicy:
       connection:
         bufferLimit: 16777216  # 16 MiB

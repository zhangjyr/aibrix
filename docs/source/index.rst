AIBrix is an open-source initiative designed to provide essential building blocks to construct scalable GenAI inference infrastructure. 
AIBrix delivers a cloud-native solution optimized for deploying, managing, and scaling large language model (LLM) inference, tailored specifically to enterprise needs.

Key features:

- **LLM Gateway and Routing**: Efficiently manage and direct traffic across multiple models and replicas.
- **High-Density LoRA Management**: Streamlined support for lightweight, low-rank adaptations of models.
- **Distributed Inference**: Scalable architecture to handle large workloads across multiple nodes.
- **LLM App-Tailored Autoscaler**: Dynamically scale inference resources based on real-time demand.
- **Unified AI Runtime**: A versatile sidecar enabling metric standardization, model downloading, and management.
- **Heterogeneous-GPU Inference**: Cost-effective SLO-driven LLM inference using heterogeneous GPUs.
- **GPU Hardware Failure Detection**: Proactive detection of GPU hardware issues.
- **KVCache Offloading and Cross-Engine KV Reuse**: High-Performance KVCache offloading framework supporting both naive KV offloading and cross-engine KV reuse.
- **Benchmark Tool**: A tool for measuring inference performance and resource efficiency.

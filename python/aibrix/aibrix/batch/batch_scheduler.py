"""BatchScheduler: the scheduling routine for the in-process / standalone path.

A scheduler is *mechanism* + *policy*. This class is the mechanism: it holds the
queue, admits jobs (``validate_job`` -> in-progress), expires past-due jobs, and
runs the perpetual loop that picks the next job and dispatches it to that job's
driver. The *ordering* — which job goes next — is delegated to a pluggable
``SchedulingPolicy`` (FIFO now, prefix-aware / priority later).

Dispatching a picked job to its driver is a scheduler's job (pick + dispatch,
like an OS scheduler); the per-job execution itself lives in the JobDriver.

"""Endpoint source: where the reachable channels come from, and how many.

The source is the single seam for deployment topology. A gateway / ClusterIP /
external LB yields exactly one self-balancing channel (the engine Router then
degenerates to identity); direct-to-pod and discovery yield N channels. The
``capacity`` signal feeds the engine's concurrency sizing.

Source methods on the hot request path should be best-effort and avoid raising:
return an empty channel set when nothing is currently reachable, and keep
``refresh`` / channel-error reporting non-fatal in individual implementations.
The engine still keeps an outer safety net so an unexpected raw exception does
not escape as a job-level internal error.

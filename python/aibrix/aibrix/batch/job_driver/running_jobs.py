"""RunningJobs: the role interface a ``JobDriver`` uses to drive one job.

This is the *driver's* view of the job manager — pull the next request, report
completions, and mark the job's terminal outcome, all by ``job_id``. The driver
depends only on this narrow interface (not the concrete BatchManager), which
breaks the driver<->manager import cycle.

Relationship to ``JobProgressTracker``: the tracker is the per-job *state* (the
launch/complete bitmap for one job). ``RunningJobs`` is the *operations*
interface the driver calls; the manager answers the per-request calls below from
each job's tracker. A driver never touches a tracker directly.

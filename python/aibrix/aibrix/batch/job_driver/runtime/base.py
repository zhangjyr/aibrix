"""Runtime: the single axis of the job lifecycle — *where compute lives*.

A ``Runtime`` provisions compute into a reachable ``Endpoint`` and tears it
down. The job driver owns the phase template (validate / prepare / run_job /
finalize); the runtime only owns provision/wait-ready/connect/teardown. A new
backend (k8s-deployment, k8s-job-sidecar, Lambda, RunPod, OpenAI, local) is a
new ``Runtime`` — never a new driver.

The four sub-phases are explicit (rather than hidden in one ``session`` body) so
that an SSH-launch backend can express "launch vLLM" in ``provision`` and "poll
/health" in ``wait_ready`` as first-class steps instead of an opaque blob.
``RuntimeBase`` implements ``session`` as the four-phase bracket with guaranteed
teardown; subclasses override only the sub-phases they need and inherit a NOOP
for the rest.

NOTE (resource-health watch, deferred): a runtime does NOT continuously monitor
the compute it provisioned. ``wait_ready`` is startup-readiness only. If the
backend dies mid-job, failure surfaces through inference errors (the dispatch
engine) or the job's completion window. A cross-provider ``monitor()`` seam
(k8s watch / EC2 describe / lambda poll) is a documented future extension, not
built here.

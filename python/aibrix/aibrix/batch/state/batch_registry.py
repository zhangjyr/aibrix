"""BatchRegistry: the service-level in-memory job registry.

This is the *collection* of all jobs the process knows about, partitioned into
three pools by lifecycle stage — pending (awaiting scheduling), in-progress
(active; holds JobMetaInfo), and done (terminal). It is the source-of-truth
registry that the API (list/get), the scheduler, and the orchestrator read.

It deliberately holds no policy: *which* pool a job belongs to (which can depend
on whether a scheduler is wired) and *when* to move it are decided by the
orchestrator (BatchManager); the store just holds the pools and answers reads.
Extracting it out of BatchManager makes the service-level "registry" concern a
named component instead of three loose dicts on the god object.
